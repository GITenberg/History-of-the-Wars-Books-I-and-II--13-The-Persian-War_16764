<p>
Procopius is known to posterity as the historian of the eventful reign
of Justinian (527-565 A.D.), and the chronicler of the great deeds of
the general Belisarius. He was born late in the fifth century in the
city of Caesarea in Palestine. As to his education and early years we
are not informed, but we know that he studied to fit himself for the
legal profession. He came as a young man to Constantinople, and seems
to have made his mark immediately. For as early as the year 527 he was
appointed legal adviser and private secretary<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61" /><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

to Belisarius, then a
very young man who had been serving on the staff of the general
Justinian, and had only recently been advanced to the office of
general. Shortly after this Justinian was called by his uncle Justinus
to share the throne of the Roman Empire, and four months later
Justinus died, leaving Justinian sole emperor of the Romans. Thus the
stage was set for the scenes which are presented in the pages of
Procopius. His own activity continued till well nigh the end of
Justinian's life, and he seems to have outlived his hero, Belisarius.</p>

<p>During the eventful years of Belisarius' campaigning in Africa, in
Italy, and in the East, Procopius was moving about with him and was an
eye-witness of the events he describes in his writings. In 527 we find
him in Mesopotamia; in 533 he accompanied Belisarius to Africa; and in
536 he journeyed with him to Italy. He was therefore quite correct in
the assertion which he makes rather modestly in the introduction of
his history, that he was better qualified than anyone else to write
the history of that period. Besides his intimacy with Belisarius it
should be added that his position gave him the further advantage of a
certain standing at the imperial court in Constantinople, and brought
him the acquaintance of many of the leading men of his day. Thus we
have the testimony of one intimately associated with the
administration, and this, together with the importance of the events
through which he lived, makes his record exceedingly interesting as
well as historically important. One must admit that his position was
not one to encourage impartiality in his presentation of facts, and
that the imperial favour was not won by plain speaking; nevertheless
we have before us a man who could not obliterate himself enough to
play the abject flatterer always, and he gives us the reverse, too, of
his brilliant picture, as we shall see presently.</p>
<p>
Procopius' three works give us a fairly complete account of the
reign of Justinian up till near the year 560 A.D., and he has done us
the favour of setting forth three different points of view which vary
so widely that posterity has sometimes found it difficult to reconcile
them. His greatest work, as well as his earliest, is the <i>History of
the Wars</i>, in eight books. The material is not arranged strictly
according to chronological sequence, but so that the progress of
events may be traced separately in each one of three wars. Thus the
first two books are given over to the Persian wars, the next two
contain the account of the war waged against the Vandals in Africa,
the three following describe the struggle against the Goths in Italy.
These seven books were published together first, and the eighth book
was added later as a supplement to bring the history up to about the
date of 554, being a general account of events in different parts of
the empire. It is necessary to bear in mind that the wars described
separately by Procopius overlapped one another in time, and that while
the Romans were striving to hold back the Persian aggressor they were
also maintaining armies in Africa and in Italy. In fact the Byzantine
empire was making a supreme effort to re-establish the old boundaries,
and to reclaim the territories lost to the barbarian nations. The
emperor Justinian was fired by the ambition to make the Roman Empire
once more a world power, and he drained every resource in his
eagerness to make possible the fulfilment of this dream. It was a
splendid effort, but it was doomed to failure; the fallen edifice
could not be permanently restored.
</p>
<p>The history is more eneral than the title would imply, and all the
important events of the time are touched upon. So while we read much
of the campaigns against the nations who were crowding back the
boundaries of the old empire, we also hear of civic affairs such as
the great Nika insurrection in Byzantium in 532; similarly a careful
account is given of the pestilence of 540, and the care shewn in
describing the nature of the disease shews plainly that the author
must have had some acquaintance with the medical science of the time.</p>
<p>
After the seventh book of the <i>History of the Wars</i> Procopius wrote
the <i>Anecdota</i>, or <i>Secret History</i>. Here he freed himself from all
the restraints of respect or fear, and set down without scruple
everything which he had been led to suppress or gloss over in the
<i>History</i> through motives of policy. He attacks unmercifully the
emperor and empress and even Belisarius and his wife Antonina, and
displays to us one of the blackest pictures ever set down in writing.
It is a record of wanton crime and shameless debauchery, of intrigue
and scandal both in public and in private life. It is plain that the
thing is overdone, and the very extravagance of the calumny makes it
impossible to be believed; again and again we meet statements which,
if not absolutely impossible, are at least highly improbable. Many of
the events of the <i>History</i> are presented in an entirely new light;
we seem to hear one speaking out of the bitterness of his heart. It
should be said, at the same time, that there are very few
contradictions in statements of fact. The author has plainly singled
out the empress Theodora as the principal victim of his venomous
darts, and he gives an account of her early years which is both
shocking and disgusting, but which, happily, we are not forced to
regard as true. It goes without saying that such a work as this could
not have been published during the lifetime of the author, and it
appears that it was not given to the world until after the death of
Justinian in 565.</p>
<p>
Serious doubts have been entertained in times past as to the
authenticity of the <i>Anecdota</i>, for at first sight it seems impossible
that the man who wrote in the calm tone of the <i>History</i> and who
indulged in the fulsome praise of the panegyric <i>On the Buildings</i>
could have also written the bitter libels of the <i>Anecdota</i>. It has
come to be seen, however, that this feeling is not supported by any
unanswerable arguments, and it is now believed to be highly probable
at least, that the <i>Anecdota</i> is the work of Procopius. Its bitterness
may be extreme and its calumnies exaggerated beyond all reason, but it
must be regarded as prompted by a reaction against the hollow life of
the Byzantine court.</p>
<p>
The third work is entitled <i>On the Buildings</i>, and is plainly an
attempt to gain favour with the emperor. We can only guess as to what
the immediate occasion was for its composition. It is plain,
however, that the publication of the <i>History</i> could not have aroused
the enthusiasm of Justinian; there was no attempt in it to praise the
emperor, and one might even read an unfavourable judgment between the
lines. And it is not at all unlikely that he was moved to envy by the
praises bestowed upon his general, Belisarius. At any rate the work
<i>On the Buildings</i> is written in the empty style of the fawning
flatterer. It is divided into six short books and contains an account
of all the public buildings of Justinian's reign in every district of
the empire. The subject was well chosen and the material ample, and
Procopius lost no opportunity of lauding his sovereign to the skies.
It is an excellent example of the florid panegyric style which was,
unfortunately, in great favour with the literary world of his own as
well as later Byzantine times. But in spite of its faults, this work
is a record of the greatest importance for the study of the period,
since it is a storehouse of information concerning the internal
administration of the empire.</p>
<p>
The style of Procopius is in general clear and straightforward, and
shews the mind of one who endeavours to speak the truth in simple
language wherever he is not under constraint to avoid it. At the same
time he is not ignorant of the arts of rhetoric, and especially in the
speeches he is fond of introducing sounding phrases and sententious
statements. He was a great admirer of the classical writers of
prose, and their influence is everywhere apparent in his writing; in
particular he is much indebted to the historians Herodotus and
Thucydides, and he borrows from them many expressions and turns of
phrase. But the Greek which he writes is not the pure Attic, and we
find many evidences of the influence of the contemporary spoken
language.</p>
<p>
Procopius writes at times as a Christian, and at times as one imbued
with the ideas of the ancient religion of Greece. Doubtless his study
of the classical writers led him into this, perhaps unconsciously. At
any rate it seems not to have been with him a matter in which even
consistency was demanded. It was politic to espouse the religion of
the state, but still he often allows himself to speak as if he were a
contemporary of Thucydides.</p>

<p>
The <i>editio princeps</i> of Procopius was published by David Hoeschel,
Augsburg, 1607; the <i>Secret History</i> was not included, and only
summaries of the six books of the work <i>On the Buildings</i> were given.
The edition is not important except as being the first.</p>
<p>
The <i>Secret History</i> was printed for the first time separately with a
Latin translation by Alemannus, Lyon, 1623.</p>
<p>
The first complete edition was that of Maltretus, Paris, 1661-63,
reprinted in Venice, 1729; the edition included a Latin translation of
all the works, which was taken over into the edition of Procopius in
the <i>Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae</i> by Dindorf, Bonn,
1833-38.</p>
<p>

<h4>THE PERSIAN WAR</h4>
<br /> <br />
<p>I</p>

<p>Procopius of Caesarea has written the history of the wars which
Justinian, Emperor of the Romans, waged against the barbarians of the
East and of the West, relating separately the events of each one, to
the end that the long course of time may not overwhelm deeds of
singular importance through lack of a record, and thus abandon them to
oblivion and utterly obliterate them. The memory of these events he
deemed would be a great thing and most helpful to men of the present
time, and to future generations as well, in case time should ever
again place men under a similar stress. For men who purpose to enter
upon a war or are preparing themselves for any kind of struggle may
derive some benefit from a narrative of a similar situation in
history, inasmuch as this discloses the final result attained by men
of an earlier day in a struggle of the same sort, and foreshadows, at
least for those who are most prudent in planning, what outcome present
events will probably have. Furthermore he had assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_i_3" id="PageI_i_3">[3-9]</a></span> he
was especially competent to write the history of these events, if for
no other reason, because it fell to his lot, when appointed adviser to
the general Belisarius, to be an eye-witness of practically all the
events to be described. It was his conviction that while cleverness is
appropriate to rhetoric, and inventiveness to poetry, truth alone is
appropriate to history. In accordance with this principle he has not
concealed the failures of even his most intimate acquaintances, but
has written down with complete accuracy everything which befell those
concerned, whether it happened to be done well or ill by them.</p> <p> It will
be evident that no more important or mightier deeds are to be found in
history than those which have been enacted in these wars,&mdash;provided
one wishes to base his judgment on the truth. For in them more
remarkable feats have been performed than in any other wars with which
we are acquainted; unless, indeed, any reader of this narrative should
give the place of honour to antiquity, and consider contemporary
achievements unworthy to be counted remarkable. There are those, for
example, who call the soldiers of the present day &quot;bowmen,&quot; while to
those of the most ancient times they wish to attribute such lofty
terms as &quot;hand-to-hand fighters,&quot; &quot;shield-men,&quot; and other names of
that sort; and they think that the valour of those times has by no
means survived to the present,&mdash;an opinion which is at once careless
and wholly remote from actual experience of these matters. For the
thought has never occurred to them that, as regards the Homeric bowmen
who had the misfortune to be ridiculed by this term<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" /><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> derived from
their art, they were neither carried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_i_9" id="PageI_i_9">[9-15]</a></span> horse nor protected by
spear or shield.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In fact there was no protection at all for their
bodies; they entered battle on foot, and were compelled to conceal
themselves, either singling out the shield of some comrade,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" /><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or
seeking safety behind a tombstone on a mound,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from which position
they could neither save themselves in case of rout, nor fall upon a
flying foe. Least of all could they participate in a decisive struggle
in the open, but they always seemed to be stealing something which
belonged to the men who were engaged in the struggle. And apart from
this they were so indifferent in their practice of archery that they
drew the bowstring only to the breast,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" /><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> so that the missile sent
forth was naturally impotent and harmless to those whom it hit.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" /><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Such, it is evident, was the archery of the past. But the bowmen of
the present time go into battle wearing corselets and fitted out with
greaves which extend up to the knee. From the right side hang their
arrows, from the other the sword. And there are some who have a spear
also attached to them and, at the shoulders, a sort of small shield
without a grip, such as to cover the region of the face and neck. They
are expert horsemen, and are able without difficulty to direct their
bows to either side while riding at full speed, and to shoot an
opponent whether in pursuit or in flight. They draw the bowstring
along by the forehead about opposite the right ear, thereby charging
the arrow with such an impetus as to kill whoever stands in the way,
shield and corselet alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_i_15" id="PageI_i_15">[15-5]</a></span> having no power to check its force.
Still there are those who take into consideration none of these
things, who reverence and worship the ancient times, and give no
credit to modern improvements. But no such consideration will prevent
the conclusion that most great and notable deeds have been performed
in these wars. And the history of them will begin at some distance
back, telling of the fortunes in war of the Romans and the Medes,
their reverses and their successes.</p>
<br />
<p>II</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">408 A.D.</span>
When the Roman Emperor Arcadius was at the point of
death in Byzantium, having a malechild, Theodosius, who was still
unweaned, he felt grave fears not only for him but for the government
as well, not knowing how he should provide wisely for both. For he
perceived that, if he provided a partner in government for Theodosius,
he would in fact be destroying his own son by bringing forward against
him a foe clothed in the regal power; while if he set him alone over
the empire, many would try to mount the throne, taking advantage, as
they might be expected to do, of the helplessness of the child. These
men would rise against the government, and, after destroying
Theodosius, would make themselves tyrants without difficulty, since
the boy had no kinsman in Byzantium to be his guardian. For Arcadius
had no hope that the boy's uncle, Honorius, would succour him,
inasmuch as the situation in Italy was already troublesome. And he was
equally disturbed by the attitude of the Medes, fearing lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ii_5" id="PageI_ii_5">[5-11]</a></span> these
barbarians should trample down the youthful emperor and do the Romans
irreparable harm. When Arcadius was confronted with this difficult
situation, though he had not shewn himself sagacious in other matters,
he devised a plan which was destined to preserve without trouble both
his child and his throne, either as a result of conversation with
certain of the learned men, such as are usually found in numbers among
the advisers of a sovereign, or from some divine inspiration which
came to him. For in drawing up the writings of his will, he designated
the child as his successor to the throne, but appointed as guardian
over him Isdigerdes, the Persian King, enjoining upon him earnestly in
his will to preserve the empire for Theodosius by all his power and
foresight. So Arcadius died, having thus arranged his private affairs
as well as those of the empire. But Isdigerdes, the Persian King, when
he saw this writing which was duly delivered to him, being even before
a sovereign whose nobility of character had won for him the greatest
renown, did then display a virtue at once amazing and remarkable. For,
loyally observing the behests of Arcadius, he adopted and continued
without interruption a policy of profound peace with the Romans, and
thus preserved the empire for Theodosius. Indeed, he straightway
dispatched a letter to the Roman senate, not declining the office of
guardian of the Emperor Theodosius, and threatening war against any
who should attempt to enter into a conspiracy against him.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">441 A.D.</span>
When Theodosius had grown to manhood and was in
the prime of life, and Isdigerdes had been taken from the world by
disease, Vararanes, the Persian King, invaded the Roman domains with a
mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ii_11" id="PageI_ii_11">[11-2]</a></span> army; however he did no damage, but returned to his home
without accomplishing anything. This came about in the following way.
Anatolius, General of the East, had, as it happened, been sent by the
Emperor Theodosius as ambassador to the Persians, alone and
unaccompanied; as he approached the Median army, solitary as he was,
he leapt down from his horse, and advanced on foot toward Vararanes.
And when Vararanes saw him, he enquired from those who were near who
this man could be who was coming forward. And they replied that he was
the general of the Romans. Thereupon the king was so dumbfounded by
this excessive degree of respect that he himself wheeled his horse
about and rode away, and the whole Persian host followed him. When he
had reached his own territory, he received the envoy with great
cordiality, and granted the treaty of peace on the terms which
Anatolius desired of him; one condition, however, he added, that
neither party should construct any new fortification in his own
territory in the neighbourhood of the boundary line between the two
countries. When this treaty had been executed, both sovereigns then
continued to administer the affairs of their respective countries as
seemed best to them.</p>
<br />
<p>III</p>

<p>At a later time the Persian King Perozes became involved in a war
concerning boundaries with the nation of the Ephthalitae Huns, who are
called White Huns, gathered an imposing army, and marched against
them. The Ephthalitae are of the stock of the Huns in fact as well as
in name; however they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iii_2" id="PageI_iii_2">[2-8]</a></span> do not mingle with any of the Huns known to
us, for they occupy a land neither adjoining nor even very near to
them; but their territory lies immediately to the north of Persia;
indeed their city, called Gorgo, is located over against the Persian
frontier, and is consequently the centre of frequent contests
concerning boundary lines between the two peoples. For they are not
nomads like the other Hunnic peoples, but for a long period have been
established in a goodly land. As a result of this they have never made
any incursion into the Roman territory except in company with the
Median army. They are the only ones among the Huns who have white
bodies and countenances which are not ugly. It is also true that their
manner of living is unlike that of their kinsmen, nor do they live a
savage life as they do; but they are ruled by one king, and since they
possess a lawful constitution, they observe right and justice in their
dealings both with one another and with their neighbours, in no degree
less than the Romans and the Persians. Moreover, the wealthy citizens
are in the habit of attaching to themselves friends to the number of
twenty or more, as the case may be, and these become permanently their
banquet-companions, and have a share in all their property, enjoying
some kind of a common right in this matter. Then, when the man who has
gathered such a company together comes to die, it is the custom that
all these men be borne alive into the tomb with him.</p>

<p>Perozes, marching against these Ephthalitae, was accompanied by an
ambassador, Eusebius by name, who, as it happened, had been sent to
his court by the Emperor Zeno. Now the Ephthalitae made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iii_8" id="PageI_iii_8">[8-13]</a></span> appear
to their enemy that they had turned to flight because they were wholly
terrified by their attack, and they retired with all speed to a place
which was shut in on every side by precipitous mountains, and
abundantly screened by a close forest of wide-spreading trees. Now as
one advanced between the mountains to a great distance, a broad way
appeared in the valley, extending apparently to an indefinite
distance, but at the end it had no outlet at all, but terminated in
the very midst of the circle of mountains. So Perozes, with no thought
at all of treachery, and forgetting that he was marching in a hostile
country, continued the pursuit without the least caution. A small body
of the Huns were in flight before him, while the greater part of their
force, by concealing themselves in the rough country, got in the rear
of the hostile army; but as yet they desired not to be seen by them,
in order that they might advance well into the trap and get as far as
possible in among the mountains, and thus be no longer able to turn
back. When the Medes began to realize all this (for they now began to
have a glimmering of their peril), though they refrained from speaking
of the situation themselves through fear of Perozes, yet they
earnestly entreated Eusebius to urge upon the king, who was completely
ignorant of his own plight, that he should take counsel rather than
make an untimely display of daring, and consider well whether there
was any way of safety open to them. So he went before Perozes, but by
no means revealed the calamity which was upon them; instead he began
with a fable, telling how a lion once happened upon a goat bound down
and bleating on a mound of no very great height, and how the lion,
bent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iii_13" id="PageI_iii_13">[13-19]</a></span> making a feast of the goat, rushed forward with intent to
seize him, but fell into a trench exceedingly deep, in which was a
circular path, narrow and endless (for it had no outlet anywhere),
which indeed the owners of the goat had constructed for this very
purpose, and they had placed the goat above it to be a bait for the
lion. When Perozes heard this, a fear came over him lest perchance the
Medes had brought harm upon themselves by their pursuit of the enemy.
He therefore advanced no further, but, remaining where he was, began
to consider the situation. By this time the Huns were following him
without any concealment, and were guarding the entrance of the place
in order that their enemy might no longer be able to withdraw to the
rear. Then at last the Persians saw clearly in what straits they were,
and they felt that the situation was desperate; for they had no hope
that they would ever escape from the peril. Then the king of the
Ephthalitae sent some of his followers to Perozes; he upbraided him at
length for his senseless foolhardiness, by which he had wantonly
destroyed both himself and the Persian people, but he announced that
even so the Huns would grant them deliverance, if Perozes should
consent to prostrate himself before him as having proved himself
master, and, taking the oaths traditional among the Persians, should
give pledges that they would never again take the field against the
nation of the Ephthalitae. When Perozes heard this, he held a
consultation with the Magi who were present and enquired of them
whether he must comply with the terms dictated by the enemy. The Magi
replied that, as to the oath, he should settle the matter according
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iii_19" id="PageI_iii_19">[19-5]</a></span> his own pleasure; as for the rest, however, he should circumvent
his enemy by craft. And they reminded him that it was the custom among
the Persians to prostrate themselves before the rising sun each day;
he should, therefore, watch the time closely and meet the leader of
the Ephthalitae at dawn, and then, turning toward the rising sun, make
his obeisance. In this way, they explained, he would be able in the
future to escape the ignominy of the deed. Perozes accordingly gave
the pledges concerning the peace, and prostrated himself before his
foe exactly as the Magi had suggested, and so, with the whole Median
army intact, gladly retired homeward.</p>
<br />
<p>IV</p>

<p>Not long after this, disregarding the oath he had sworn, he was eager
to avenge himself upon the Huns for the insult done him. He therefore
straightway gathered together from the whole land all the Persians and
their allies, and led them against the Ephthalitae; of all his sons he
left behind him only one, Cabades by name, who, as it happened, was
just past the age of boyhood; all the others, about thirty in number,
he took with him. The Ephthalitae, upon learning of his invasion, were
aggrieved at the deception they had suffered at the hands of their
enemy, and bitterly reproached their king as having abandoned them to
the Medes. He, with a laugh, enquired of them what in the world of
theirs he had abandoned, whether their land or their arms or any other
part of their possessions. They thereupon retorted that he had
abandoned nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iv_5" id="PageI_iv_5">[5-10]</a></span> except, forsooth, the one opportunity on which,
as it turned out, everything else depended. Now the Ephthalitae with
all zeal demanded that they should go out to meet the invaders, but
the king sought to restrain them at any rate for the moment. For he
insisted that as yet they had received no definite information as to
the invasion, for the Persians were still within their own boundaries.
So, remaining where he was, he busied himself as follows. In the plain
where the Persians were to make their irruption into the land of the
Ephthalitae he marked off a tract of very great extent and made a deep
trench of sufficient width; but in the centre he left a small portion
of ground intact, enough to serve as a way for ten horses. Over the
trench he placed reeds, and upon the reeds he scattered earth, thereby
concealing the true surface. He then directed the forces of the Huns
that, when the time came to retire inside the trench, they should draw
themselves together into a narrow column and pass rather slowly across
this neck of land, taking care that they should not fall into the
ditch.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" /><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And he hung from the top of the royal banner the salt over
which Perozes had once sworn the oath which he had disregarded in
taking the field against the Huns. Now as long as he heard that the
enemy were in their own territory, he remained at rest; but when he
learned from his scouts that they had reached the city of Gorgo which
lies on the extreme Persian frontier, and that departing thence they
were now advancing against his army, remaining himself with the
greater part of his troops inside the trench, he sent forward a
small<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iv_10" id="PageI_iv_10">[10-16]</a></span> detachment with instructions to allow themselves to be seen
at a distance by the enemy in the plain, and, when once they had been
seen, to flee at full speed to the rear, keeping in mind his command
concerning the trench as soon as they drew near to it. They did as
directed, and, as they approached the trench, they drew themselves
into a narrow column, and all passed over and joined the rest of the
army. But the Persians, having no means of perceiving the stratagem,
gave chase at full speed across a very level plain, possessed as they
were by a spirit of fury against the enemy, and fell into the trench,
every man of them, not alone the first but also those who followed in
the rear. For since they entered into the pursuit with great fury, as
I have said, they failed to notice the catastrophe which had befallen
their leaders, but fell in on top of them with their horses and
lances, so that, as was natural, they both destroyed them, and were
themselves no less involved in ruin. Among them were Perozes and all
his sons. And just as he was about to fall into this pit, they say
that he realized the danger, and seized and threw from him the pearl
which hung from his right ear,&mdash;a gem of wonderful whiteness and
greatly prized on account of its extraordinary size&mdash;in order, no
doubt, that no one might wear it after him; for it was a thing
exceedingly beautiful to look upon, such as no king before him had
possessed. This story, however, seems to me untrustworthy, because a
man who found himself in such peril would have thought of nothing
else; but I suppose that his ear was crushed in this disaster, and the
pearl disappeared somewhere or other. This pearl the Roman Emperor
then made every effort to buy from the Ephthalitae, but was utterly
unsuccessful. <span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iv_16" id="PageI_iv_16">[16-22]</a></span>
For the barbarians were not able to find it although they sought it
with great labour. However, they say that the Ephthalitae found it
later and sold it to Cabades.</p>

<p>The story of this pearl, as told by the Persians, is worth recounting,
for perhaps to some it may not seem altogether incredible. For they
say that it was lodged in its oyster in the sea which washes the
Persian coast, and that the oyster was swimming not far from the
shore; both its valves were standing open and the pearl lay between
them, a wonderful sight and notable, for no pearl in all history could
be compared with it at all, either in size or in beauty. A shark,
then, of enormous size and dreadful fierceness, fell in love with this
sight and followed close upon it, leaving it neither day nor night;
even when he was compelled to take thought for food, he would only
look about for something eatable where he was, and when he found some
bit, he would snatch it up and eat it hurriedly; then overtaking the
oyster immediately, he would sate himself again with the sight he
loved. At length a fisherman, they say, noticed what was passing, but
in terror of the monster he recoiled from the danger; however, he
reported the whole matter to the king, Perozes. Now when Perozes heard
his account, they say that a great longing for the pearl came over
him, and he urged on this fisherman with many flatteries and hopes of
reward. Unable to resist the importunities of the monarch, he is said
to have addressed Perozes as follows: &quot;My master, precious to a man is
money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iv_22" id="PageI_iv_22">[22-27]</a></span> more precious still is his life, but most prized of all are
his children; and being naturally constrained by his love for them a
man might perhaps dare anything. Now I intend to make trial of the
monster, and hope to make thee master of the pearl. And if I succeed
in this struggle, it is plain that henceforth I shall be ranked among
those who are counted blessed. For it is not unlikely that thou, as
King of Kings, wilt reward me with all good things; and for me it will
be sufficient, even if it so fall out that I gain no reward, to have
shewn myself a benefactor of my master. But if it must needs be that I
become the prey of this monster, thy task indeed it will be, O King,
to requite my children for their father's death. Thus even after my
death I shall still be a wage-earner among those closest to me, and
thou wilt win greater fame for thy goodness,&mdash;for in helping my
children thou wilt confer a boon upon me, who shall have no power to
thank thee for the benefit&mdash;because generosity is seen to be without
alloy only when it is displayed towards the dead.&quot; With these words he
departed. And when he came to the place where the oyster was
accustomed to swim and the shark to follow, he seated himself there
upon a rock, watching for an opportunity of catching the pearl alone
without its admirer. As soon as it came about that the shark had
happened upon something which would serve him for food, and was
delaying over it, the fisherman left upon the beach those who were
following him for this service, and made straight for the oyster with
all his might; already he had seized it and was hastening with all
speed to get out of the water, when the shark noticed him and rushed
to the rescue. The fisherman saw him coming, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_iv_29" id="PageI_iv_29">[29-1]</a></span> when he was about
to be overtaken not far from the beach, he hurled his booty with all
his force upon the land, and was himself soon afterwards seized and
destroyed. But the men who had been left upon the beach picked up the
pearl, and, conveying it to the king, reported all that had happened.
Such, then, is the story which the Persians relate, just as I have set
it down, concerning this pearl. But I shall return to the previous
narrative.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">484 A.D.</span>
Thus Perozes was destroyed and the whole Persian
army with him. For the few who by chance did not fall into the ditch
found themselves at the mercy of the enemy. As a result of this
experience a law was established among the Persians that, while
marching in hostile territory, they should never engage in any
pursuit, even if it should happen that the enemy had been
driven back by force. Thereupon those who had not marched with Perozes
and had remained in their own land chose as their king Cabades, the
youngest son of Perozes, who was then the only one surviving. At that
time, then, the Persians became subject and tributary to the
Ephthalitae, until Cabades had established his power most securely and
no longer deemed it necessary to pay the annual tribute to them. And
the time these barbarians ruled over the Persians was two years.</p>
<br />
<p>V</p>

<p>

But as time went on Cabades became more high-handed in the
administration of the government, and introduced innovations into the
constitution, among which was a law which he promulgated providing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_1" id="PageI_v_1">[1-7]</a></span>
that Persians should have communal intercourse with their women, a
measure which by no means pleased the common people.
<span class="sidenote">486 A.D.</span>
Accordingly they
rose against him, removed him from the throne, and kept him in prison
in chains. They then chose Blases, the brother of Perozes, to be their
king, since, as has been said, no male offspring of Perozes was left,
and it is not lawful among the Persians for any man by birth a common
citizen to be set upon the throne, except in case the royal family be
totally extinct. Blases, upon receiving the royal power, gathered
together the nobles of the Persians and held a conference concerning
Cabades; for it was not the wish of the majority to put the man to
death. After the expression of many opinions on both sides there came
forward a certain man of repute among the Persians, whose name was
Gousanastades, and whose office that of &quot;chanaranges&quot; (which would be
the Persian term for general); his official province lay on the very
frontier of the Persian territory in a district which adjoins the land
of the Ephthalitae. Holding up his knife, the kind with which the
Persians were accustomed to trim their nails, of about the length of a
man's finger, but not one-third as wide as a finger, he said: &quot;You see
this knife, how extremely small it is; nevertheless it is able at the
present time to accomplish a deed, which, be assured, my dear
Persians, a little later two myriads of mail-clad men could not bring
to pass.&quot; This he said hinting that, if they did not put Cabades to
death, he would straightway make trouble for the Persians. But they
were altogether unwilling to put to death a man of the royal blood,
and decided to confine him<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_7" id="PageI_v_7">[7-15]</a></span> in a castle which it is their habit to
call the &quot;Prison of Oblivion.&quot; For if anyone is cast into it, the law
permits no mention of him to be made thereafter, but death is the
penalty for the man who speaks his name; for this reason it has
received this title among the Persians. On one occasion, however, the
History of the Armenians relates that the operation of the law
regarding the Prison of Oblivion was suspended by the Persians in the
following way.</p>

<p>There was once a truceless war, lasting two and thirty years, between
the Persians and the Armenians, when Pacurius was king of the
Persians, and of the Armenians, Arsaces, of the line of the Arsacidae.
And by the long continuance of this war it came about that both sides
suffered beyond measure, and especially the Armenians. But each nation
was possessed by such great distrust of the other that neither of them
could make overtures of peace to their opponents. In the meantime it
happened that the Persians became engaged in a war with certain other
barbarians who lived not far from the Armenians. Accordingly the
Armenians, in their eagerness to make a display to the Persians of
their goodwill and desire for peace, decided to invade the land of
these barbarians, first revealing their plan to the Persians. Then
they fell upon them unexpectedly and killed almost the whole
population, old and young alike. Thereupon Pacurius, who was overjoyed
at the deed, sent certain of his trusted friends to Arsaces, and
giving him pledges of security, invited him to his presence. And when
Arsaces came to him he shewed him every kindness, and treated him as a
brother on an equal footing with himself. Then he bound him by the
most solemn oaths, and he himself swore likewise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_15" id="PageI_v_15">[15-22]</a></span> that in very
truth the Persians and Armenians should thenceforth be friends and
allies to each other; thereafter he straightway dismissed Arsaces to
return to his own country.</p>

<p>Not long after this certain persons slandered Arsaces, saying that he
was purposing to undertake some seditious enterprise. Pacurius was
persuaded by these men and again summoned him, intimating that he was
anxious to confer with him on general matters. And he, without any
hesitation at all, came to the king, taking with him several of the
most warlike among the Armenians, and among them Bassicius, who was at
once his general and counsellor; for he was both brave and sagacious
to a remarkable degree. Straightway, then, Pacurius heaped reproach
and abuse upon both Arsaces and Bassicius, because, disregarding the
sworn compact, they had so speedily turned their thoughts toward
secession. They, however, denied the charge, and swore most
insistently that no such thing had been considered by them. At first,
therefore, Pacurius kept them under guard in disgrace, but after a
time he enquired of the Magi what should be done with them. Now the
Magi deemed it by no means just to condemn men who denied their guilt
and had not been explicitly found guilty, but they suggested to him an
artifice by which Arsaces himself might be compelled to become openly
his own accuser. They bade him cover the floor of the royal tent with
earth, one half from the land of Persia, and the other half from
Armenia. This the king did as directed. Then the Magi, after putting
the whole tent under a spell by means of some magic rites, bade the
king take his walk there<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_22" id="PageI_v_22">[22-28]</a></span> in company with Arsaces, reproaching him
meanwhile with having violated the sworn agreement. They said,
further, that they too must be present at the conversation, for in
this way there would be witnesses of all that was said. Accordingly
Pacurius straightway summoned Arsaces, and began to walk to and fro
with him in the tent in the presence of the Magi; he enquired of the
man why he had disregarded his sworn promises, and was setting about
to harass the Persians and Armenians once more with grievous troubles.
Now as long as the conversation took place on the ground which was
covered with the earth from the land of Persia, Arsaces continued to
make denial, and, pledging himself with the most fearful oaths,
insisted that he was a faithful subject of Pacurius. But when, in the
midst of his speaking, he came to the centre of the tent where they
stepped upon Armenian earth, then, compelled by some unknown power, he
suddenly changed the tone of his words to one of defiance, and from
then on ceased not to threaten Pacurius and the Persians, announcing
that he would have vengeance upon them for this insolence as soon as
he should become his own master. These words of youthful folly he
continued to utter as they walked all the way, until turning back, he
came again to the earth from the Persian land. Thereupon, as if
chanting a recantation, he was once more a suppliant, offering
pitiable explanations to Pacurius. But when he came again to the
Armenian earth, he returned to his threats. In this way he changed
many times to one side and the other, and concealed none of his
secrets. Then at length the Magi passed judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_28" id="PageI_v_28">[28-35]</a></span> against him as
having violated the treaty and the oaths. Pacurius flayed Bassicius,
and, making a bag of his skin, filled it with chaff and suspended it
from a lofty tree. As for Arsaces, since Pacurius could by no means
bring himself to kill a man of the royal blood, he confined him in the
Prison of Oblivion.</p>

<p>After a time, when the Persians were marching against a barbarian
nation, they were accompanied by an Armenian who had been especially
intimate with Arsaces and had followed him when he went into the
Persian land. This man proved himself a capable warrior in this
campaign, as Pacurius observed, and was the chief cause of the Persian
victory. For this reason Pacurius begged him to make any request he
wished, assuring him that he would be refused nothing by him. The
Armenian asked for nothing else than that he might for one day pay
homage to Arsaces in the way he might desire. Now it annoyed the king
exceedingly, that he should be compelled to set aside a law so
ancient; however, in order to be wholly true to his word, he permitted
that the request be granted. When the man found himself by the king's
order in the Prison of Oblivion, he greeted Arsaces, and both men,
embracing each other, joined their voices in a sweet lament, and,
bewailing the hard fate that was upon them, were able only with
difficulty to release each other from the embrace. Then, when they had
sated themselves with weeping and ceased from tears, the Armenian
bathed Arsaces, and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_v_35" id="PageI_v_35">[35-1]</a></span> adorned his person, neglecting
nothing, and, putting on him the royal robe, caused him to recline on
a bed of rushes. Then Arsaces entertained those present with a royal
banquet just as was formerly his custom. During this feast many
speeches were made over the cups which greatly pleased Arsaces, and
many incidents occurred which delighted his heart. The drinking was
prolonged until nightfall, all feeling the keenest delight in their
mutual intercourse; at length they parted from each other with great
reluctance, and separated thoroughly imbued with happiness. Then they
tell how Arsaces said that after spending the sweetest day of his
life, and enjoying the company of the man he had missed most of all,
he would no longer willingly endure the miseries of life; and with
these words, they say, he dispatched himself with a knife which, as it
happened, he had purposely stolen at the banquet, and thus departed
from among men. Such then is the story concerning this Arsaces,
related in the Armenian History just as I have told it, and it was on
that occasion that the law regarding the Prison of Oblivion was set
aside. But I must return to the point from which I have strayed.</p>
<br />
<p>VI</p>

<p>While Cabades was in the prison he was cared for by his wife, who went
in to him constantly and carried him supplies of food. Now the keeper
of the prison began to make advances to her, for she was exceedingly
beautiful to look upon. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vi_2" id="PageI_vi_2">[2-9]</a></span> Cabades learned this from his
wife, he bade her give herself over to the man to treat as he wished.
In this way the keeper of the prison came to be familiar with the
woman, and he conceived for her an extraordinary love, and as a result
permitted her to go in to her husband just as she wished, and to
depart from there again without interference from anyone. Now there
was a Persian notable, Seoses by name, a devoted friend of Cabades,
who was constantly in the neighbourhood of this prison, watching his
opportunity, in the hope that he might in some way be able to effect
his deliverance. And he sent word to Cabades through his wife that he
was keeping horses and men in readiness not far from the prison, and
he indicated to him a certain spot. Then one day as night drew near
Cabades persuaded his wife to give him her own garment, and, dressing
herself in his clothes, to sit instead of him in the prison where he
usually sat. In this way, therefore, Cabades made his escape from the
prison. For although the guards who were on duty saw him, they
supposed that it was the woman, and therefore decided not to hinder or
otherwise annoy him. At daybreak they saw in the cell the woman in her
husband's clothes, and were so completely deceived as to think that
Cabades was there, and this belief prevailed during several days,
until Cabades had advanced well on his way. As to the fate which
befell the woman after the stratagem had come to light, and the manner
in which they punished her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vi_9" id="PageI_vi_9">[9-17]</a></span> I am unable to speak with accuracy. For
the Persian accounts do not agree with each other, and for this reason
I omit the narration of them.</p>

<p>

Cabades, in company
with Seoses, completely escaped detection, and reached the Ephthalitae
Huns; there the king gave him his daughter in marriage, and then,
since Cabades was now his son-in-law, he put under his command a very
formidable army for a campaign against the Persians. This army the
Persians were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made haste to
flee in every direction. And when Cabades reached the territory where
Gousanastades exercised his authority, he stated to some of his
friends that he would appoint as chanaranges the first man of the
Persians who should on that day come into his presence and offer his
services. But even as he said this, he repented his speech, for there
came to his mind a law of the Persians which ordains that offices
among the Persians shall not be conferred upon others than those to
whom each particular honour belongs by right of birth. For he feared
lest someone should come to him first who was not a kinsman of the
present chanaranges, and that he would be compelled to set aside the
law in order to keep his word. Even as he was considering this matter,
chance brought it about that, without dishonouring the law, he could
still keep his word. For the first man who came to him happened to be
Adergoudounbades, a young man who was a relative of Gousanastades and
an especially capable warrior. He addressed Cabades as &quot;Lord,&quot; and was
the first to do obeisance to him as king, and besought him to use him
as a slave for any service whatever.
<span class="sidenote">488 A.D.</span>
So Cabades made his way into the
royal palace without<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vi_17" id="PageI_vi_17">[17-2]</a></span> any trouble, and, taking Blases destitute of
defenders, he put out his eyes, using the method of blinding commonly
employed by the Persians against malefactors, that is, either by
heating olive oil and pouring it, while boiling fiercely, into the
wide-open eyes, or by heating in the fire an iron needle, and with
this pricking the eyeballs. Thereafter Blases was kept in confinement,
having ruled over the Persians two years. Gousanastades was put to
death and Adergoudounbades was established in his place in the office
of chanaranges, while Seoses was immediately proclaimed &quot;adrastadaran
salanes,&quot;&mdash;a title designating the one set in authority over all
magistrates and over the whole army. Seoses was the first and only man
who held this office in Persia; for it was conferred on no one before
or after that time. And the kingdom was strengthened by Cabades and
guarded securely; for in shrewdness and activity he was surpassed by
none.</p>
<br />
<p>VII.</p>

<p>A little later Cabades was owing the king of the Ephthalitae a sum of
money which he was not able to pay him, and he therefore requested the
Roman emperor Anastasius to lend him this money. Whereupon Anastasius
conferred with some of his friends and enquired of them whether this
should be done; and they would not permit him to make the loan. For,
as they pointed out, it was inexpedient to make more secure by means
of their money the friendship between their enemies and the
Ephthalitae; indeed it was better for the Romans to disturb their<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_2" id="PageI_vii_2">[2-8]</a></span>
relations as much as possible. It was for this reason, and for no just
cause, that Cabades decided to make an expedition against the Romans.
<span class="sidenote">502 A.D.</span>

First he invaded the land of the Armenians, moving with such rapidity
as to anticipate the news of his coming, and, after plundering the
greater part of it in a rapid campaign, he unexpectedly arrived at the
city of Amida, which is situated in Mesopotamia, and, although the
season was winter, he invested the town. Now the citizens of Amida had
no soldiers at hand, seeing that it was a time of peace and
prosperity, and in other respects were utterly unprepared;
nevertheless they were quite unwilling to yield to the enemy, and
shewed an unexpected fortitude in holding out against dangers and
hardships.</p>

<p>Now there was among the Syrians a certain just man, Jacobus by name,
who had trained himself with exactitude in matters pertaining to
religion. This man had confined himself many years before in a place
called Endielon, a day's journey from Amida, in order that he might
with more security devote himself to pious contemplation. The men of
this place, assisting his purpose, had surrounded him with a kind of
fencing, in which the stakes were not continuous, but set at
intervals, so that those who approached could see and hold converse
with him. And they had constructed for him a small roof over his head,
sufficient to keep off the rain and snow. There this man had been
sitting for a long time, never yielding either to heat or cold, and
sustaining his life with certain seeds, which he was accustomed to
eat, not indeed every day, but only at long intervals. Now some of the
Ephthalitae<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_8" id="PageI_vii_8">[8-13]</a></span> who were overrunning the country thereabout saw this
Jacobus and with great eagerness drew their bows with intent to shoot
at him. But the hands of every one of them became motionless and
utterly unable to manage the bow. When this was noised about through
the army and came to the ears of Cabades, he desired to see the thing
with his own eyes; and when he saw it, both he and the Persians who
were with him were seized with great astonishment, and he entreated
Jacobus to forgive the barbarians their crime. And he forgave them
with a word, and the men were released from their distress. Cabades
then bade the man ask for whatever he wished, supposing that he would
ask for a great sum of money, and he also added with youthful
recklessness that he would be refused nothing by him. But he requested
Cabades to grant to him all the men who during that war should come to
him as fugitives. This request Cabades granted, and gave him a written
pledge of his personal safety. And great numbers of men, as might be
expected, came flocking to him from all sides and found safety there;
for the deed became widely known. Thus, then, did these things take
place.</p>

<p>Cabades, in besieging Amida, brought against every part of the
defences the engines known as rams; but the townspeople constantly
broke off the heads of the rams by means of timbers thrown across
them.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" /><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> However, Cabades did not slacken his efforts until he
realized that the wall could not be successfully assailed in this way.
For, though he battered the wall many times, he was quite unable to
break down any portion of the defence, or even to shake it; so
secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_13" id="PageI_vii_13">[13-19]</a></span> had been the work of the builders who had constructed it
long before. Failing in this, Cabades raised an artificial hill to
threaten the city, considerably overtopping the wall; but the
besieged, starting from the inside of their defences, made a tunnel
extending under the hill, and from there stealthily carried out the
earth, until they hollowed out a great part of the inside of the hill.
However, the outside kept the form which it had at first assumed, and
afforded no opportunity to anyone of discovering what was being done.
Accordingly many Persians mounted it, thinking it safe, and stationed
themselves on the summit with the purpose of shooting down upon the
heads of those inside the fortifications. But with the great mass of
men crowding upon it with a rush, the hill suddenly fell in and killed
almost all of them. Cabades, then, finding no remedy for the
situation, decided to raise the siege, and he issued orders to the
army to retreat on the morrow. Then indeed the besieged, as though
they had no thought of their danger, began laughingly from the
fortifications to jeer at the barbarians. Besides this some courtesans
shamelessly drew up their clothing and displayed to Cabades, who was
standing close by, those parts of a woman's body which it is not
proper that men should see uncovered. This was plainly seen by the
Magi, and they thereupon came before the king and tried to prevent the
retreat, declaring as their interpretation of what had happened that
the citizens of Amida would shortly disclose to Cabades all their
secret and hidden things. So the Persian army remained there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_20" id="PageI_vii_20">[20-27]</a></span></p>

<p>

Not many days later one of the Persians saw close by one of the towers
the mouth of an old underground passage, which was insecurely
concealed with some few small stones. In the night he came there
alone, and, making trial of the entrance, got inside the circuit-wall;
then at daybreak he reported the whole matter to Cabades. The king
himself on the following night came to the spot with a few men,
bringing ladders which he had made ready. And he was favoured by a
piece of good fortune; for the defence of the very tower which
happened to be nearest to the passage had fallen by lot to those of
the Christians who are most careful in their observances, whom they
call monks. These men, as chance would have it, were keeping some
annual religious festival to God on that day. When night came on they
all felt great weariness<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" /><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on account of the festival, and, having
sated themselves with food and drink beyond their wont, they fell into
a sweet and gentle sleep, and were consequently quite unaware of what
was going on. So the Persians made their way through the passage
inside the fortifications, a few at a time, and, mounting the tower,
they found the monks still sleeping and slew them to a man. When
Cabades learned this, he brought his ladders up to the wall close by
this tower. It was already day. And those of the townsmen who were
keeping guard on the adjoining tower became aware of the disaster, and
ran thither with all speed to give assistance. Then for a long time
both sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_27" id="PageI_vii_27">[27-33]</a></span> struggled to crowd back the other, and already the
townsmen were gaining the advantage, killing many of those who had
mounted the wall, and throwing back the men on the ladders, and they
came very near to averting the danger. But Cabades drew his sword and,
terrifying the Persians constantly with it, rushed in person to the
ladders and would not let them draw back, and death was the punishment
for those who dared turn to leave. As a result of this the Persians by
their numbers gained the upper hand and overcame their antagonists in
the fight. So the city was captured by storm on the eightieth day
after the beginning of the siege.
<span class="sidenote">Jan. 11 503 A.D.</span>
There followed a great massacre of
the townspeople, until one of the citizens&mdash;an old man and a
priest&mdash;approached Cabades as he was riding into the city, and said
that it was not a kingly act to slaughter captives. Then Cabades,
still moved with passion, replied: &quot;But why did you decide to fight
against me?&quot; And the old man answered quickly: &quot;Because God willed to
give Amida into thy hand not so much because of our decision as of thy
valour.&quot; Cabades was pleased by this speech, and permitted no further
slaughter, but he bade the Persians plunder the property and make
slaves of the survivors, and he directed them to choose out for
himself all the notables among them.</p>

<p>A short time after this he departed, leaving there to garrison the
place a thousand men under command of Glones, a Persian, and some few
unfortunates among the citizens of Amida who were destined to minister
as servants to the daily wants of the Persians; he himself with all
the remainder of the army and the captives marched away homeward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_vii_33" id="PageI_vii_33">[33-3]</a></span>
These captives were treated by Cabades with a generosity befitting a
king; for after a short time he released all of them to return to
their homes, but he pretended that they had escaped from him by
stealth;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" /><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the Roman Emperor, Anastasius, also shewed them
honour worthy of their bravery, for he remitted to the city all the
annual taxes for the space of seven years, and presented all of them
as a body and each one of them separately with many good things, so
that they came fully to forget the misfortunes which had befallen
them. But this happened in later years.</p>
<br />
<p>VIII</p>

<p>At that time the Emperor Anastasius, upon learning that Amida was
being besieged, dispatched with all speed an army of sufficient
strength. But in this army there were general officers in command of
every symmory,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" /><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> while the supreme command was divided between the
following four generals: Areobindus, at that time General of the East,
the son-in-law of Olyvrius, who had been Emperor in the West not long
before; Celer, commander of the palace troops (this officer the Romans
are accustomed to call &quot;magister&quot;); besides these still, there were
the commanders of troops in Byzantium, Patricias, the Phrygian, and
Hypatius, the nephew of the emperor; these four, then, were the
generals. With them also was associated Justinus, who at a later time
became emperor upon the death of Anastasius, and Patriciolus with his
son Vitalianus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_viii_3" id="PageI_viii_3">[3-8]</a></span> who raised an armed insurrection against the
Emperor Anastasius not long afterwards and made himself tyrant; also
Pharesmanes, a native of Colchis, and a man of exceptional ability as
a warrior, and the Goths Godidisklus and Bessas, who were among those
Goths who had not followed Theoderic when he went from Thrace into
Italy, both of them men of the noblest birth and experienced in
matters pertaining to warfare; many others, too, who were men of high
station, joined this army. For such an army, they say, was never
assembled by the Romans against the Persians either before or after
that time. However, all these men did not assemble in one body, nor
did they form a single army as they marched, but each commander by
himself led his own division separately against the enemy. And as
manager of the finances of the army Apion, an Aegyptian, was sent, a
man of eminence among the patricians and extremely energetic; and the
emperor in a written statement declared him partner in the royal
power, in order that he might have authority to administer the
finances as he wished.</p>

<p>Now this army was mustered with considerable delay, and advanced with
little speed. As a result of this they did not find the barbarians in
the Roman territory; for the Persians had made their attack suddenly,
and had immediately withdrawn with all their booty to their own land.
Now no one of the generals desired for the present to undertake the
siege of the garrison left in Amida, for they learned that they had
carried in a large supply of provisions; but they made haste to invade
the land of the enemy. However they did not advance together against
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_viii_8" id="PageI_viii_8">[8-15]</a></span> barbarians but they encamped apart from one another as they
proceeded. When Cabades learned this (for he happened to be close by),
he came with all speed to the Roman frontier and confronted them. But
the Romans had not yet learned that Cabades was moving against them
with his whole force, and they supposed that some small Persian army
was there. Accordingly the forces of Areobindus established their camp
in a place called Arzamon, at a distance of two days' journey from the
city of Constantina, and those of Patricius and Hypatius in a place
called Siphrios, which is distant not less than three hundred and
fifty stades from the city of Amida. As for Celer, he had not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>

Areobindus, when he ascertained that Cabades was coming upon them with
his whole army, abandoned his camp, and, in company with all his men,
turned to flight and retired on the run to Constantina. And the enemy,
coming up not long afterwards, captured the camp without a man in it
and all the money it contained. From there they advanced swiftly
against the other Roman army. Now the troops of Patricius and Hypatius
had happened upon eight hundred Ephthalitae who were marching in
advance of the Persian army, and they had killed practically all of
them. Then, since they had learned nothing of Cabades and the Persian
army, supposing that they had won the victory, they began to conduct
themselves with less caution. At any rate they had stacked their arms
and were preparing themselves a lunch; for already the appropriate
time of day was drawing near. Now a small stream flowed in this place
and in it the Romans began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_viii_15" id="PageI_viii_15">[15-22]</a></span> wash the pieces of meat which they
were about to eat; some, too, distressed by the heat, were bathing
themselves in the stream; and in consequence the brook flowed on with
a muddy current. But while Cabades, learning what had befallen the
Ephthalitae, was advancing against the enemy with all speed, he
noticed that the water of the brook was disturbed, and divining what
was going on, he came to the conclusion that his opponents were
unprepared, and gave orders to charge upon them immediately at full
speed.
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 503 A.D.</span>
Straightway, then, they fell upon them feasting and unarmed.
And the Romans did not withstand their onset, nor did they once think
of resistance, but they began to flee as each one could; and some of
them were captured and slain, while others climbed the hill which
rises there and threw themselves down the cliff in panic and much
confusion. And they say that not a man escaped from there; but
Patricius and Hypatius had succeeded in getting away at the beginning
of the onset. After this Cabades retired homeward with his whole army,
since hostile Huns had made an invasion into his land, and with this
people he waged a long war in the northerly portion of his realm. In
the meantime the other Roman army also came, but they did nothing
worth recounting, because, it seems, no one was made
commander-in-chief of the expedition; but all the generals were of
equal rank, and consequently they were always opposing one another's
opinions and were utterly unable to unite. However Celer, with his
contingent, crossed the Nymphius River and made some sort of an
invasion into Arzanene. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_viii_22" id="PageI_viii_22">[22-4]</a></span> river is one very close to
Martyropolis, about three hundred stades from Amida. So Celer's troops
plundered the country thereabout and returned not long after, and the
whole invasion was completed in a short time.</p>
<br />
<p>IX</p>

<p>After this Areobindus went to Byzantium at the summons of the emperor,
while the other generals reached Amida, and, in spite of the winter
season, invested it. And although they made many attempts they were
unable to carry the fortress by storm, but they were on the point of
accomplishing their object by starvation; for all the provisions of
the besieged were exhausted. The generals, however, had ascertained
nothing of the straits in which the enemy were; but since they saw
that their own troops were distressed by the labour of the siege and
the wintry weather, and at the same time suspected that a Persian army
would be coming upon them before long, they were eager to quit the
place on any terms whatever. The Persians, on their part, not knowing
what would become of them in such terrible straits, continued to
conceal scrupulously their lack of the necessities of life, and made
it appear that they had an abundance of all provisions, wishing to
return to their homes with the reputation of honour. So a proposal was
discussed between them, according to which the Persians were to
deliver over the city to the Romans upon receipt of one thousand
pounds of gold. Both parties then gladly executed the terms of the
agreement, and the son of Glones, upon receiving the money, delivered
over Amida to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ix_4" id="PageI_ix_4">[4-10]</a></span> Romans. For Glones himself had already died in
the following manner.</p>

<p>When the Romans had not yet encamped before the city of Amida but were
not far from its vicinity, a certain countryman, who was accustomed to
enter the city secretly with fowls and loaves and many other
delicacies, which he sold to this Glones at a great price, came before
the general Patricius and promised to deliver into his hands Glones
and two hundred Persians, if he should receive from him assurance of
some requital. And the general promised that he should have everything
he desired, and thus dismissed the fellow. He then tore his garments
in a dreadful manner, and, assuming the aspect of one who had been
weeping, entered the city. And coming before Glones, and tearing his
hair he said: &quot;O Master, I happened to be bringing in for you all the
good things from my village, when some Roman soldiers chanced upon me
(for, as you know, they are constantly wandering about the country
here in small bands and doing violence to the miserable country-folk),
and they inflicted upon me blows not to be endured, and, taking away
everything, they departed,&mdash;the robbers, whose ancient custom it is to
fear the Persians and to beat the farmers. But do you, O Master, take
thought to defend yourself and us and the Persians. For if you go
hunting into the outskirts of the city, you will find rare game. For
the accursed rascals go about by fours or fives to do their robbery.&quot;
Thus he spoke. And Glones was persuaded, and enquired of the fellow
about how many Persians he thought would be sufficient for him to
carry out the enterprise. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ix_10" id="PageI_ix_10">[10-16]</a></span> said that about fifty would do, for
they would never meet more than five of them going together; however,
in order to forestall any unexpected circumstance, it would do no harm
to take with him even one hundred men; and if he should double this
number it would be still better from every point of view; for no harm
could come to a man from the larger number. Glones accordingly picked
out two hundred horsemen and bade the fellow lead the way for them.
But he insisted that it was better for him to be sent first to spy out
the ground, and, if he should bring back word that he had seen Romans
still going about in the same districts, that then the Persians should
make their sally at the fitting moment. Accordingly, since he seemed
to Glones to speak well, he was sent forward by his own order. Then he
came before the general Patricius and explained everything; and the
general sent with him two of his own body-guard and a thousand
soldiers. These he concealed about a village called Thilasamon, forty
stades distant from Amida, among valleys and woody places, and
instructed them to remain there in this ambush; he himself then
proceeded to the city on the run, and telling Glones that the prey was
ready, he led him and the two hundred horsemen upon the ambush of the
enemy. And when they passed the spot where the Romans were lying in
wait, without being observed by Glones or any of the Persians, he
roused the Romans from their ambuscade and pointed out to them the
enemy. And when the Persians saw the men coming against them, they
were astounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ix_16" id="PageI_ix_16">[16-22]</a></span> at the suddenness of the thing, and were in much
distress what to do. For neither could they retire to the rear, since
their opponents were behind them, nor were they able to flee anywhere
else in a hostile land. But as well as they could under the
circumstances, they arrayed themselves for battle and tried to drive
back their assailants; but being at a great disadvantage in numbers
they were vanquished, and all of them together with Glones were
destroyed. Now when the son of Glones learned of this, being deeply
grieved and at the same time furious with anger because he had not
been able to defend his father, he fired the sanctuary of Symeon, a
holy man, where Glones had his lodging. It must be said, however, that
with the exception of this one building, neither Glones nor Cabades,
nor indeed any other of the Persians, saw fit either to tear down or
to destroy in any other way any building in Amida at any rate, or
outside this city. But I shall return to the previous narrative.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">504 A.D.</span>
Thus the Romans by giving the money recovered
Amida two years after it had been captured by the enemy. And when they
got into the city, their own negligence and the hardships under which
the Persians had maintained themselves were discovered. For upon
reckoning the amount of grain left there and the number of barbarians
who had gone out, they found that rations for about seven days were
left in the city, although Glones and his son had been for a long time
doling out provisions to the Persians more sparingly than they were
needed. For to the Romans who had remained with them in the city, as I
have stated above, they had decided to dispense nothing at all from
the time when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ix_22" id="PageI_ix_22">[22-2]</a></span> enemy began the siege; and so these men at
first resorted to unaccustomed foods and laid hold on every forbidden
thing, and at the last they even tasted each other's blood. So the
generals realized that they had been deceived by the barbarians, and
they reproached the soldiers for their lack of
self-control, because
they had shewn themselves wanting in obedience to them, when it was
possible to capture as prisoners of war such a multitude of Persians
and the son of Glones and the city itself, while they had in
consequence attached to themselves signal disgrace by carrying Roman
money to the enemy, and had taken Amida from the Persians by
purchasing it with silver.
<span class="sidenote">506 A.D.</span>
After this the
Persians, since their war with the Huns kept dragging on, entered into
a treaty with the Romans, which was arranged by them for seven years,
and was made by the Roman Celer and the Persian Aspebedes; both armies
then retired homeward and remained at peace. Thus, then, as has been
told, began the war of the Romans and the Persians, and to this end
did it come. But I shall now turn to the narration of the events
touching the Caspian Gates.</p>
<br />
<p>X</p>

<p>The Taurus mountain range of Cilicia passes first Cappadocia and
Armenia and the land of the so-called Persarmenians, then also Albania
and Iberia and all the other countries in this region, both
independent and subject to Persia. For it extends to a great distance,
and as one proceeds along this range, it always spreads out to an
extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_x_2" id="PageI_x_2">[2-10]</a></span> breadth and rises to an imposing height. And as one
passes beyond the boundary of Iberia there is a sort of path in a very
narrow passage, extending for a distance of fifty stades. This path
terminates in a place cut off by cliffs and, as it seems, absolutely
impossible to pass through. For from there no way out appears, except
indeed a small gate set there by nature, just as if it had been made
by the hand of man, which has been called from of old the Caspian
Gates. From there on there are plains suitable for riding and
extremely well watered, and extensive tracts used as pasture land for
horses, and level besides. Here almost all the nations of the Huns are
settled, extending as far as the Maeotic lake. Now if these Huns go
through the gate which I have just mentioned into the land of the
Persians and the Romans, they come with their horses fresh and without
making any detour or encountering any precipitous places, except in
those fifty stades over which, as has been said, they pass to the
boundary of Iberia. If, however, they go by any other passes, they
reach their destination with great difficulty, and can no longer use
the same horses. For the detours which they are forced to make are
many and steep besides. When this was observed by Alexander, the son
of Philip, he constructed gates in the aforesaid place and established
a fortress there. And this was held by many men in turn as time went
on, and finally by Ambazouces, a Hun by birth, but a friend of the
Romans and the Emperor Anastasius. Now when this Ambazouces had
reached an advanced age and was near to death, he sent to Anastasius
asking that money be given him, on condition that he hand over the
fortress and the Caspian<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_x_10" id="PageI_x_10">[10-18]</a></span> Gates to the Romans. But the Emperor
Anastasius was incapable of doing anything without careful
investigation, nor was it his custom to act thus: reasoning,
therefore, that it was impossible for him to support soldiers in a
place which was destitute of all good things, and which had nowhere in
the neighbourhood a nation subject to the Romans, he expressed deep
gratitude to the man for his good-will toward him, but by no means
accepted this proposition. So Ambazouces died of disease not long
afterwards, and Cabades overpowered his sons and took possession of
the Gates.</p>

<p>The Emperor Anastasius, after concluding the treaty with Cabades,
built a city in a place called Daras, exceedingly strong and of real
importance, bearing the name of the emperor himself. Now this place is
distant from the city of Nisibis one hundred stades lacking two, and
from the boundary line which divides the Romans from the Persians
about twenty-eight. And the Persians, though eager to prevent the
building, were quite unable to do so, being constrained by the war
with the Huns in which they were engaged. But as soon as Cabades
brought this to an end, he sent to the Romans and accused them of
having built a city hard by the Persian frontier, though this had been
forbidden in the agreement previously made between the Medes and the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" /><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At that time, therefore, the Emperor Anastasius desired,
partly by threats, and partly by emphasizing his friendship with him
and by bribing him with no mean sum of money, to deceive him and to
remove the accusation. And another city also was built by this
emperor, similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_x_18" id="PageI_x_18">[18-5]</a></span> to the first, in Armenia, hard by the boundaries
of Persarmenia; now in this place there had been a village from of
old, but it had taken on the dignity of a city by the favour of the
Emperor Theodosius even to the name, for it had come to be named after
him.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" /><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But Anastasius surrounded it with a very substantial wall,
and thus gave offence to the Persians no less than by the other city;
for both of them are strongholds menacing their country.</p>
<br />
<p>XI</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 1, 518 A.D.</span>
And when a little later Anastasius died, Justinus received the empire,
forcing aside all the kinsmen of Anastasius, although they were
numerous and also very distinguished. Then indeed a sort of anxiety
came over Cabades, lest the Persians should make some attempt to
overthrow his house as soon as he should end his life; for it was
certain that he would not pass on the kingdom to any one of his sons
without opposition. For while the law called to the throne the eldest
of his children Caoses by reason of his age, he was by no means
pleasing to Cabades; and the father's judgment did violence to the law
of nature and of custom as well. And <a name="PageI_xi_4"></a>Zames, who was second in age,
having had one of his eyes struck out, was prevented by the law. For
it is not lawful for a one-eyed man or one having any other deformity
to become king over the Persians. But Chosroes, who was born to him by
the sister of Aspebedes, the father loved exceedingly; seeing,
however, that all the Persians, practically speaking, felt an
extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_5" id="PageI_xi_5">[5-11]</a></span> admiration for the manliness of Zames (for he was a
capable warrior), and worshipped his other virtues, he feared lest
they should rise against Chosroes and do irreparable harm to the
family and to the kingdom. Therefore it seemed best to him to arrange
with the Romans to put an end both to the war and the causes of war,
on condition that Chosroes be made an adopted son of the Emperor
Justinus; for only in this way could he preserve stability in the
government. Accordingly he sent envoys to treat of this matter and a
letter to the Emperor Justinus in Byzantium. And the letter was
written in this wise: &quot;Unjust indeed has been the treatment which we
have received at the hands of the Romans, as even you yourself know,
but I have seen fit to abandon entirely all the charges against you,
being assured of this, that the most truly victorious of all men would
be those who, with justice on their side, are still willingly overcome
and vanquished by their friends. However I ask of you a certain favour
in return for this, which would bind together in kinship and in the
good-will which would naturally spring from this relation not only
ourselves but also all our subjects, and which would be calculated to
bring us to a satiety of the blessings of peace. My proposal, then, is
this, that you should make my son Chosroes, who will be my successor
to the throne, your adopted son.&quot;</p>

<p>When this message was brought to the Emperor Justinus, he himself was
overjoyed and Justinian also, the nephew of the emperor, who indeed
was expected to receive from him the empire. And they were making all
haste to perform the act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_11" id="PageI_xi_11">[11-17]</a></span> setting down in Writing the adoption,
as the law of the Romans prescribes&mdash;and would have done so, had they
not been prevented by Proclus, who was at that time a counsellor to
the emperor, holding the office of quaestor, as it is called, a just
man and one whom it was manifestly impossible to bribe; for this
reason he neither readily proposed any law, nor was he willing to
disturb in any way the settled order of things; and he at that time
also opposed the proposition, speaking as follows: &quot;To venture on
novel projects is not my custom, and indeed I dread them more than any
others; for where there is innovation security is by no means
preserved. And it seems to me that, even if one should be especially
bold in this matter, he would feel reluctance to do the thing and
would tremble at the storm which would arise from it; for I believe
that nothing else is before our consideration at the present time than
the question how we may hand over the Roman empire to the Persians on
a seemly pretext. For they make no concealment nor do they employ any
blinds, but explicitly acknowledging their purpose they claim without
more ado to rob us of our empire, seeking to veil the manifestness of
their deceit under a shew of simplicity, and hide a shameless intent
behind a pretended unconcern. And yet both of you ought to repel this
attempt of the barbarians with all your power; thou, O Emperor, in
order that thou mayst not be the last Emperor of the Romans, and thou,
O General, that thou mayst not prove a stumbling block to thyself as
regards coming to the throne. For other crafty devices which are
commonly concealed by a pretentious shew of words might perhaps need
an interpreter for the many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_17" id="PageI_xi_17">[17-22]</a></span> but this embassy openly and straight
from the very first words means to make this Chosroes, whoever he is,
the adopted heir of the Roman Emperor. For I would have you reason thus
in this matter: by nature the possessions of fathers are due to their
sons and while the laws among all men are always in conflict with each
other by reason of their varying nature, in this matter both among the
Romans and among all barbarians they are in agreement and harmony with
each other, in that they declare sons to be masters of their fathers'
inheritance. Take this first resolve if you choose: if you do you must
agree to all its consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Proclus; and the emperor and his nephew gave ear to his
words and deliberated upon what should be done. In the meantime
Cabades sent another letter also to the Emperor Justinus, asking him
to send men of repute in order to establish peace with him, and to
indicate by letter the manner in which it would be his desire to
accomplish the adoption of his son. And then, indeed, still more than
before Proclus decried the attempt of the Persians, and insisted that
their concern was to make over to themselves as securely as possible
the Roman power. And he proposed as his opinion that the peace should
be concluded with them with all possible speed, and that the noblest
men should be sent by the emperor for this purpose; and that these men
must answer plainly to Cabades, when he enquired in what manner the
adoption of Chosroes should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_22" id="PageI_xi_22">[22-28]</a></span> accomplished, that it must be of the
sort befitting a barbarian, and his meaning was that the barbarians
adopt sons, not by a document, but by arms and armour.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" /><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Accordingly
the Emperor Justinus dismissed the envoys, promising that men who were
the noblest of the Romans would follow them not long afterwards, and
that they would arrange a settlement regarding the peace and regarding
Chosroes in the best possible way. He also answered Cabades by letter
to the same effect. Accordingly there were sent from the Romans
Hypatius, the nephew of Anastasius, the late emperor, a patrician who
also held the office of General of the East, and Rufinus, the son of
Silvanus, a man of note among the patricians and known to Cabades
through their fathers; from the Persians came one of great power and
high authority, Seoses by name, whose title was adrastadaran salanes,
and Mebodes, who held the office of magister. These men came together
at a certain spot which is on the boundary line between the land of
the Romans and the Persians: there they met and negotiated as to how
they should do away with their differences and settle effectually the
question of the peace. Chosroes also came to the Tigris River, which
is distant from the city of Nisibis about two days journey, in order
that, when the details of the peace should seem to both parties to be
as well arranged as possible, he might betake himself in person to
Byzantium. Now many words were spoken on both sides touching the
differences between them, and in particular Seoses made mention of the
land of Colchis, which is now called<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_28" id="PageI_xi_28">[28-33]</a></span> Lazica, saying that it had
been subject to the Persians from of old and that the Romans had taken
it from them by violence and held it on no just grounds. When the
Romans heard this, they were indignant to think that even Lazica
should be disputed by the Persians. And when they in turn stated that
the adoption of Chosroes must take place just as is proper for a
barbarian, it seemed to the Persians unbearable. The two parties
therefore separated and departed homeward, and Chosroes with nothing
accomplished was off to his father, deeply injured at what had taken
place and vowing vengeance on the Romans for their insult to him.</p>

<p>After this Mebodes began to slander Seoses to Cabades, saying that he
had proposed the discussion of Lazica purposely, although he had not
been instructed to do so by his master, thereby frustrating the peace,
and also that he had had words previously with Hypatius, who was by no
means well-disposed toward his own sovereign and was trying to prevent
the conclusion of peace and the adoption of Chosroes; and many other
accusations also were brought forward by the enemies of Seoses, and he
was summoned to trial. Now the whole Persian council gathered to sit
in judgment moved more by envy than by respect for the law. For they
were thoroughly hostile to his office, which was unfamiliar to them,
and also were embittered by the natural temper of the man. For while
Seoses was a man quite impossible to bribe, and a most exact respecter
of justice, he was afflicted with a degree of arrogance not to be
compared with that of any other. This quality, indeed, seems to be
inbred in the Persian officials, but in Seoses even they thought that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xi_33" id="PageI_xi_33">[33-1]</a></span> malady had developed to an altogether extraordinary degree. So
his accusers said all those things which have been indicated above,
and added to this that the man was by no means willing to live in the
established fashion or to uphold the institutions of the Persians. For
he both reverenced strange divinities, and lately, when his wife had
died, he had buried her, though it was forbidden by the laws of the
Persians ever to hide in the earth the bodies of the dead. The judges
therefore condemned the man to death, while Cabades, though seeming to
be deeply moved with sympathy as a friend of Seoses, was by no means
willing to rescue him. He did not, on the other hand, make it known
that he was angry with him, but, as he said, he was not willing to
undo the laws of the Persians, although he owed the man the price of
his life, since Seoses was chiefly responsible both for the fact that
he was alive and also that he was king. Thus, then, Seoses was
condemned and was removed from among men. And the office which began
with him ended also with him. For no other man has been made
adrastadaran salanes. Rufinus also slandered Hypatius to the emperor.
As a result of this the emperor reduced him from his office, and
tortured most cruelly certain of his associates only to find out that
this slander was absolutely unsound; beyond this, however, he did
Hypatius no harm.</p>
<br />
<p>XII</p>

<p>Immediately after this, Cabades, though eager to make some kind of an
invasion into the land of the Romans, was utterly unable to do so on
account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xii_1" id="PageI_xii_1">[1-9]</a></span> the following obstacle which happened to arise. The
Iberians, who live in Asia, are settled in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Caspian Gates, which lie to the north of them. Adjoining them
on the left towards the west is Lazica, and on the right towards the
east are the Persian peoples. This nation is Christian and they guard
the rites of this faith more closely than any other men known to us,
but they have been subjects of the Persian king, as it happens, from
ancient times. And just then Cabades was desirous of forcing them to
adopt the rites of his own religion. And he enjoined upon their king,
Gourgenes, to do all things as the Persians are accustomed to do them,
and in particular not under any circumstances to hide their dead in
the earth, but to throw them all to the birds and dogs. For this
reason, then, Gourgenes wished to go over to the Emperor Justinus, and
he asked that he might receive pledges that the Romans would never
abandon the Iberians to the Persians. And the emperor gave him these
pledges with great eagerness, and he sent Probus, the nephew of the
late emperor Anastasius, a man of patrician rank, with a great sum of
money to Bosporus, that he might win over with money an army of Huns
and send them as allies to the Iberians. This Bosporus is a city by
the sea, on the left as one sails into the so-called Euxine Sea,
twenty days journey distant from the city of Cherson, which is the
limit of the Roman territory. Between these cities everything is held
by the Huns. Now in ancient times the people of Bosporus were
autonomous, but lately they had decided to become subject to the
Emperor Justinus. Probus, however, departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xii_9" id="PageI_xii_9">[9-17]</a></span> from there without
accomplishing his mission, and the emperor sent Peter as general with
some Huns to Lazica to fight with all their strength for Gourgenes.
Meanwhile Cabades sent a very considerable army against Gourgenes and
the Iberians, and as general a Persian bearing the title of &quot;varizes,&quot;
Boes by name. Then it was seen that Gourgenes was too weak to
withstand the attack of the Persians, for the help from the Romans was
insufficient, and with all the notables of the Iberians he fled to
Lazica, taking with him his wife and children and also his brothers,
of whom Peranius was the eldest. And when they had reached the
boundaries of Lazica, they remained there, and, sheltering themselves
by the roughness of the country, they took their stand against the
enemy. And the Persians followed after them but did nothing deserving
even of mention since the circumstance of the rough country was
against them.</p> <p>Thereafter the Iberians presented themselves at
Byzantium and Petrus came to the emperor at his summons; and from then
on the emperor demanded that he should assist the Lazi to guard their
country, even against their will, and he sent an army and Eirenaeus in
command of it. Now there are two fortresses in Lazica<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" /><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which one
comes upon immediately upon entering their country from the boundaries
of Iberia, and the defence of them had been from of old in charge of
the natives, although they experienced great hardship in this matter;
for neither corn nor wine nor any other good thing is produced there.
Nor indeed can anything be carried in from elsewhere on account of the
narrowness of the paths, unless it be carried by men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xii_17" id="PageI_xii_17">[17-24]</a></span>

However, the Lazi were able to live on a certain kind of millet which
grows there, since they were accustomed to it. These garrisons the
emperor removed from the place and commanded that Roman soldiers
should be stationed there to guard the fortresses. And at first the
Lazi with difficulty brought in provisions for these soldiers, but
later they gave up the service and the Romans abandoned these forts,
whereupon the Persians with no trouble took possession of them. This
then happened in Lazica.</p>

<p>

And the Romans, under the leadership of Sittas and Belisarius, made an
inroad into Persarmenia, a territory subject to the Persians, where
they plundered a large tract of country and then withdrew with a great
multitude of Armenian captives. These two men were both youths and
wearing their first beards,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" /><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> body-guards of the general Justinian,
who later shared the empire with his uncle Justinus. But when a second
inroad had been made by the Romans into Armenia, Narses and Aratius
unexpectedly confronted them and engaged them in battle. These men not
long after this came to the Romans as deserters, and made the
expedition to Italy with Belisarius; but on the present occasion they
joined battle with the forces of Sittas and Belisarius and gained the
advantage over them. An invasion was also made near the city of
Nisibis by another Roman army under command of Libelarius of Thrace.
This army retired abruptly in flight although no one came out against
thorn. And because of this the emperor reduced Libelarius from his
office and appointed Belisarius commander of the troops in Daras.
<span class="sidenote">527 A.D.</span>
It
was at that time that Procopius, who wrote this history, was chosen as
his adviser.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_1" id="PageI_xiii_1">[1-8]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>XIII</p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">Apr. 1, 527</span>
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 1, 527</span>
Not long after this Justinus, who had declared his nephew Justinian
emperor with him, died, and thus the empire came to Justinian alone.
This Justinian commanded Belisarius to build a fortress in a place
called Mindouos, which is over against the very boundary of Persia, on
the left as one goes to Nisibis. He accordingly with great haste began
to carry out the decision of the emperor, and the fort was already
rising to a considerable height by reason of the great number of
artisans. But the Persians forbade them to build any further,
threatening that, not with words alone but also with deeds, they would
at no distant time obstruct the work. When the emperor heard this,
inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the
place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and
also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in
Libanus.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" /><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and
inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were
gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building
operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their
power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle
took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great
slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy.
Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led
away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them
permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_8" id="PageI_xiii_8">[8-16]</a></span> one defended it
any longer, they razed what had been built to the ground.</p>
<p>
After this the Emperor Justinian appointed Belisarius General of the
East and bade him make an expedition against the Persians. And he
collected a very formidable army and came to Daras. Hermogenes also
came to him from the emperor to assist in setting the army in order,
holding the office of magister; this man was formerly counsellor to
Vitalianus at the time when he was at war with the Emperor Anastasius.
The emperor also sent Rufinus as ambassador, commanding him to remain
in Hierapolis on the Euphrates River until he himself should give the
word. For already much was being said on both sides concerning peace.
Suddenly, however, someone reported to Belisarius and Hermogenes that
the Persians were expected to invade the land of the Romans, being
eager to capture the city of Daras. And when they heard this, they
prepared for the battle as follows.
<span class="sidenote">July, 530</span>
Not far from the gate which lies
opposite the city of Nisibis, about a stone's throw away, they dug a
deep trench with many passages across it. Now this trench was not dug
in a straight line, but in the following manner. In the middle there
was a rather short portion straight, and at either end of this there
were dug two cross trenches at right angles to the first; and starting
from the extremities of the two cross trenches, they continued two
straight trenches in the original direction to a very great distance.
Not long afterwards the Persians came with a great army, and all of
them made camp in a place called Ammodios, at a distance of twenty
stades from the city of Daras. Among the leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_16" id="PageI_xiii_16">[16-21]</a></span> of this army were
Pityaxes and the one-eyed Baresmanas. But one general held command
over them all, a Persian, whose title was &quot;mirranes&quot; (for thus the
Persians designate this office), Perozes by name. This Perozes
immediately sent to Belisarius bidding him make ready the bath: for he
wished to bathe there on the following day. Accordingly the Romans
made the most vigorous preparations for the encounter, with the
expectation that they would fight on the succeeding day.</p>

<p>At sunrise, seeing the enemy advancing against them, they arrayed
themselves as follows.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" /><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The extremity of the left straight trench
which joined the cross trench, as far as the hill which rises here,
was held by Bouzes with a large force of horsemen and by Pharas the
Erulian with three hundred of his nation. On the right of these,
outside the trench, at the angle formed by the cross trench and the
straight section which extended from that point, were Sunicas and
Aigan, Massagetae by birth, with six hundred horsemen, in order that,
if those under Bouzes and Pharas should be driven back, they might, by
moving quickly on the flank, and getting in the rear of the enemy, be
able easily to support the Romans at that point. On the other wing
also they were arrayed in the same manner; for the extremity of the
straight trench was held by a large force of horsemen, who were
commanded by John, son of Nicetas, and by Cyril and Marcellus; with
them also were Germanus and Dorotheus; while at the angle on the right
six hundred horsemen took their stand, commanded by Simmas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_21" id="PageI_xiii_21">[21-29]</a></span>
Ascan, Massagetae, in order that, as has been said, in case the forces
of John should by any chance be driven back, they might move out from
there and attack the rear of the Persians. Thus all along the trench
stood the detachments of cavalry and the infantry. And behind these in
the middle stood the forces of Belisarius and Hermogenes. Thus the
Romans arrayed themselves, amounting to five-and-twenty thousand; but
the Persian army consisted of forty thousand horse and foot, and they
all stood close together facing the front, so as to make the front of
the phalanx as deep as possible. Then for a long time neither side
began battle with the other, but the Persians seemed to be wondering
at the good order of the Romans, and appeared at a loss what to do
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon a certain detachment of the horsemen who held
the right wing, separating themselves from the rest of the army, came
against the forces of Bouzes and Pharas. And the Romans retired a
short distance to the rear. The Persians, however, did not pursue
them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround
them on the part of the enemy. Then the Romans who had turned to
flight suddenly rushed upon them. And the Persians did not withstand
their onset and rode back to the phalanx, and again the forces of
Bouzes and Pharas stationed themselves in their own position. In this
skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession
of their bodies; thereafter both armies remained quietly in position.
But one Persian, a young man, riding up very close to the Roman army,
began to challenge all of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_29" id="PageI_xiii_29">[29-36]</a></span> calling for whoever wished to do
battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger,
except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes,
not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of
war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school
in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the
army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his
birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without
being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to
meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still
considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his
spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow
delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his
horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a
sacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was
raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army. But the
Persians were deeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another
horseman for the same purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to
bodily size, but not a youth, for some of the hair on his head already
shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and,
brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike
his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing.
And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the
notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden
to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with
their spears, and the weapons, driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiii_36" id="PageI_xiii_36">[36-3]</a></span> against their corselets, were
turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together
their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the
two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to
their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his
size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his
practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him
as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground
dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman
army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke
their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the
p&aelig;an, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark.
Thus both armies passed that night.</p>
<br />
<p>XIV</p>

<p>On the following day ten thousand soldiers arrived who had been
summoned by the Persians from the city of Nisibis, and Belisarius and
Hermogenes wrote to the mirranes as follows: &quot;The first blessing is
peace, as is agreed by all men who have even a small share of reason.
It follows that if any one should be a destroyer of it, he would be
most responsible not only to those near him but also to his whole
nation for the troubles which come. The best general, therefore, is
that one who is able to bring about peace from war. But you, when
affairs were well settled between the Romans and the Persians, have
seen fit to bring upon us a war without cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_3" id="PageI_xiv_3">[3-9]</a></span> although the
counsels of each king are looking toward peace, and although our
envoys are already present in the neighbourhood, who will at no
distant time settle all the points of dispute in talking over the
situation together, unless some irreparable harm coming from your
invasion proves sufficient to frustrate for us this hope. But lead
away as soon as possible your army to the land of the Persians, and do
not stand in the way of the greatest blessings, lest at some time you
be held responsible by the Persians, as is probable, for the disasters
which will come to pass.&quot; When the mirranes saw this letter brought to
him, he replied as follows: &quot;I should have been persuaded by what you
write, and should have done what you demand, were the letter not, as
it happens, from Romans, for whom the making of promises is easy, but
the fulfilment of the promises in deed most difficult and beyond hope,
especially if you sanction the agreement by any oaths. We, therefore,
despairing in view of your deception, have been compelled to come
before you in arms, and as for you, my dear Romans, consider that from
now on you will be obliged to do nothing else than make war against
the Persians. For here we shall be compelled either to die or grow old
until you accord to us justice in deed.&quot; Such was the reply which the
mirranes wrote back. And again Belisarius and his generals wrote as
follows: &quot;O excellent mirranes, it is not fitting in all things to
depend upon boasting, nor to lay upon one's neighbours reproaches
which are justified on no grounds whatever. For we said with truth
that Rufinus had come to act as an envoy and was not far away, and you
yourself will know this at no remote time. But since you are eager for
deeds of war, we shall array<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_9" id="PageI_xiv_9">[9-15]</a></span> ourselves against you with the help of
God, who will, we know, support us in the danger, being moved by the
peaceful inclination of the Romans, but rebuking the boastfulness of
the Persians and your decision to resist us when we invite you to
peace. And we shall array ourselves against you, having prepared for
the conflict by fastening the letters written by each of us on the top
of our banners.&quot; Such was the message of this letter. And the mirranes
again answered as follows: &quot;Neither are we entering upon the war
without our gods, and with their help we shall come before you, and I
expect that on the morrow they will bring the Persians into Daras. But
let the bath and lunch be in readiness for me within the
fortifications.&quot; When Belisarius and his generals read this, they
prepared themselves for the conflict.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day the mirranes called together all the Persians at
about sunrise and spoke as follows: &quot;I am not ignorant that it is not
because of words of their leaders, but because of their individual
bravery and their shame before each other that the Persians are
accustomed to be courageous in the presence of dangers. But seeing you
considering why in the world it is that, although the Romans have not
been accustomed heretofore to go into battle without confusion and
disorder, they recently awaited the advancing Persians with a kind of
order which is by no means characteristic of them, for this reason I
have decided to speak some words of exhortation to you, so that it may
not come about that you be deceived by reason of holding an opinion
which is not true. For I would not have you think that the Romans have
suddenly become better warriors, or that they have acquired any more
valour or experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_15" id="PageI_xiv_15">[15-22]</a></span> but that they have become more cowardly than
they were previously; at any rate they fear the Persians so much that
they have not even dared to form their phalanx without a trench. And
not even with this did they begin any fighting, but when we did not
join battle with them at all, joyfully and considering that matters
had gone better for them than they had hoped, they withdrew to the
wall. For this reason too it happened that they were not thrown into
confusion, for they had not yet come into the dangers of battle. But
if the fighting comes to close quarters, fear will seize upon them,
and this, together with their inexperience, will throw them, in all
probability, into their customary disorder. Such, therefore, is the
case with regard to the enemy; but do you, O men of Persia, call to
mind the judgment of the King of Kings. For if you do not play the
part of brave men in the present engagement, in a manner worthy of the
valour of the Persians, an inglorious punishment will fall upon you.&quot;
With this exhortation the mirranes began to lead his army against the
enemy. Likewise Belisarius and Hermogenes gathered all the Romans
before the fortifications, and encouraged them with the following
words: &quot;You know assuredly that the Persians are not altogether
invincible, nor too strong to be killed, having taken their measure in
the previous battle; and that, although superior to them in bravery
and in strength of body, you were defeated only by reason of being
rather heedless of your officers, no one can deny. This thing you now
have the opportunity to set right with no trouble. For while the
adversities of fortune are by no means such as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_22" id="PageI_xiv_22">[22-30]</a></span> be set right by
an effort, reason may easily become for a man a physician for the ills
caused by himself. If therefore you are willing to give heed to the
orders given, you will straightway win for yourselves the superiority
in battle. For the Persians come against us basing their confidence on
nothing else than our disorder. But this time also they will be
disappointed in this hope, and will depart just as in the previous
encounter. And as for the great numbers of the enemy, by which more
than anything else they inspire fear, it is right for you to despise
them. For their whole infantry is nothing more than a crowd of
pitiable peasants who come into battle for no other purpose than to
dig through walls and to despoil the slain and in general to serve the
soldiers. For this reason they have no weapons at all with which they
might trouble their opponents, and they only hold before themselves
those enormous shields in order that they may not possibly be hit by
the enemy. Therefore if you shew yourselves brave men in this
struggle, you will not only conquer the Persians for the present, but
you will also punish them for their folly, so that they will never
again make an expedition into the Roman territory.&quot;</p>

<p>When Belisarius and Hermogenes had finished this exhortation, since
they saw the Persians advancing against them, they hastily drew up the
soldiers in the same manner as before. And the barbarians, coming up
before them, took their stand facing the Romans. But the mirranes did
not array all the Persians against the enemy, but only one half of
them, while he allowed the others to remain behind. These were to take
the places of the men who were fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_30" id="PageI_xiv_30">[30-36]</a></span> and to fall upon their
opponents with their vigour intact, so that all might fight in
constant rotation. But the detachment of the so-called Immortals alone
he ordered to remain at rest until he himself should give the signal.
And he took his own station at the middle of the front, putting
Pityaxes in command on the right wing, and Baresmanas on the left. In
this manner, then, both armies were drawn up. Then Pharas came before
Belisarius and Hermogenes, and said: &quot;It does not seem to me that I
shall do the enemy any great harm if I remain here with the Eruli; but
if we conceal ourselves on this slope, and then, when the Persians
have begun the fight, if we climb up by this hill and suddenly come
upon their rear, shooting from behind them, we shall in all
probability do them the greatest harm.&quot; Thus he spoke, and, since it
pleased Belisarius and his staff, he carried out this plan.</p>

<p>But up to midday neither side began battle. As soon, however, as the
noon hour was passed, the barbarians began the fight, having postponed
the engagement to this time of the day for the reason that they are
accustomed to partake of food only towards late afternoon, while the
Romans have their meal before noon; and for this reason they thought
that the Romans would never hold out so well, if they assailed them
while hungry. At first, then, both sides discharged arrows against
each other, and the missiles by their great number made, as it were, a
vast cloud; and many men were falling on both sides, but the missiles
of the barbarians flew much more thickly. For fresh men were always
fighting in turn, affording to their enemy not the slightest
opportunity to observe what was being done; but even so the Romans
did<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_36" id="PageI_xiv_36">[36-44]</a></span> not have the worst of it. For a steady wind blew from their
side against the barbarians, and checked to a considerable degree the
force of their arrows. Then, after both sides had exhausted all their
missiles, they began to use their spears against each other, and the
battle had come still more to close quarters. On the Roman side the
left wing was suffering especially. For the Cadiseni, who with
Pityaxes were fighting at this point, rushing up suddenly in great
numbers, routed their enemy, and crowding hard upon the fugitives,
were killing many of them. When this was observed by the men under
Sunicas and Aigan, they charged against them at full speed. But first
the three hundred Eruli under Pharas from the high ground got in the
rear of the enemy and made a wonderful display of valorous deeds
against all of them and especially the Cadiseni. And the Persians,
seeing the forces of Sunicas too already coming up against them from
the flank, turned to a hasty flight. And the rout became complete, for
the Romans here joined forces with each other, and there was a great
slaughter of the barbarians. On the Persian right wing not fewer than
three thousand perished in this action, while the rest escaped with
difficulty to the phalanx and were saved. And the Romans did not
continue their pursuit, but both sides took their stand facing each
other in line. Such was the course of these events.</p>

<p>But the mirranes stealthily sent to the left a large body of troops
and with them all the so-called Immortals. And when these were noticed
by Belisarius and Hermogenes, they ordered the six hundred men under
Sunicas and Aigan to go to the angle on the right, where the troops of
Simmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_44" id="PageI_xiv_44">[44-51]</a></span> and Ascan were stationed, and behind them they placed many
of Belisarius men. So the Persians who held the left wing under the
leadership of Baresmanas, together with the Immortals, charged on the
run upon the Romans opposite them, who failed to withstand the attack
and beat a hasty retreat. Thereupon the Romans in the angle, and all
who were behind them, advanced with great ardour against the pursuers.
But inasmuch as they came upon the barbarians from the side, they cut
their army into two parts, and the greater portion of them they had on
their right, while some also who were left behind were placed on their
left. Among these happened to be the standard bearer of Baresmanas,
whom Sunicas charged and struck with his spear. And already the
Persians who were leading the pursuit perceived in what straits they
were, and, wheeling about, they stopped the pursuit and went against
their assailants, and thus became exposed to the enemy on both sides.
For those in flight before them understood what was happening and
turned back again. The Persians, on their part, with the detachment of
the Immortals, seeing the standard inclined and lowered to the earth,
rushed all together against the Romans at that point with Baresmanas.
There the Romans held their ground. And first Sunicas killed
Baresmanas and threw him from his horse to the ground. As a result of
this the barbarians were seized with great fear and thought no longer
of resistance, but fled in utter confusion. And the Romans, having
made a circle as it were around them, killed about five thousand. Thus
both armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xiv_51" id="PageI_xiv_51">[51-2]</a></span> were all set in motion, the Persians in retreat, and
the Romans in pursuit. In this part of the conflict all the
foot-soldiers who were in the Persian army threw down their shields
and were caught and wantonly killed by their enemy. However, the
pursuit was not continued by the Romans over a great distance. For
Belisarius and Hermogenes refused absolutely to let them go farther,
fearing lest the Persians through some necessity should turn about and
rout them while pursuing recklessly, and it seemed to them sufficient
to preserve the victory unmarred. For on that day the Persians had
been defeated in battle by the Romans, a thing which had not happened
for a long time. Thus the two armies separated from each other. And
the Persians were no longer willing to fight a pitched battle with the
Romans. However, some sudden attacks were made on both sides, in which
the Romans were not at a disadvantage. Such, then, was the fortune of
the armies in Mesopotamia.</p>
<br />
<p>XV</p>

<p>And Cabades sent another army into the part of Armenia which is
subject to the Romans. This army was composed of Persarmenians and
Sunitae, whose land adjoins that of the Alani. There were also Huns
with them, of the stock called Sabiri, to the number of three
thousand, a most warlike race. And Mermeroes, a Persian, had been made
general of the whole force. When this army was three days' march from
Theodosiopolis, they established their camp and, remaining in the land
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_2" id="PageI_xv_2">[2-10]</a></span> the Persarmenians, made their preparations for the invasion. Now
the general of Armenia was, as it happened, Dorotheus, a man of
discretion and experienced in many wars. And Sittas held the office of
general in Byzantium, and had authority over the whole army in
Armenia. These two, then, upon learning that an army was being
assembled in Persarmenia, straightway sent two body-guards with
instructions to spy out the whole force of the enemy and report to
them. And both of these men got into the barbarian camp, and after
noting everything accurately, they departed. And they were travelling
toward some place in that region, when they happened unexpectedly upon
hostile Huns. By them one of the two, Dagaris by name, was made
captive and bound, while the other succeeded in escaping and reported
everything to the generals. They then armed their whole force and made
an unexpected assault upon the camp of their enemy; and the
barbarians, panic-stricken by the unexpected attack, never thought of
resistance, but fled as best each one could. Thereupon the Romans,
after killing a large number and plundering the camp, immediately
marched back.</p>

<p>Not long after this Mermeroes, having collected the whole army,
invaded the Roman territory, and they came upon their enemy near the
city of Satala. There they established themselves in camp and remained
at rest in a place called Octava, which is fifty-six stades distant
from the city. Sittas therefore led out a thousand men and concealed
them behind one of the many hills which surround the plain in which
the city of Satala<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_10" id="PageI_xv_10">[10-15]</a></span> lies. Dorotheus with the rest of the army he
ordered to stay inside the fortifications, because they thought that
they were by no means able to withstand the enemy on level ground,
since their number was not fewer than thirty thousand, while their own
forces scarcely amounted to half that number. On the following day the
barbarians came up close to the fortifications and busily set about
closing in the town. But suddenly, seeing the forces of Sittas who by
now were coming down upon them from the high ground, and having no
means of estimating their number, since owing to the summer season a
great cloud of dust hung over them, they thought they were much more
numerous than they were, and, hurriedly abandoning their plan of
closing in the town, they hastened to mass their force into a small
space. But the Romans anticipated the movement and, separating their
own force into two detachments, they set upon them as they were
retiring from the fortifications; and when this was seen by the whole
Roman army, they took courage, and with a great rush they poured out
from the fortifications and advanced against their opponents. They
thus put the Persians between their own troops, and turned them to
flight. However, since the barbarians were greatly superior to their
enemy in numbers, as has been said, they still offered resistance, and
the battle had become a fierce fight at close quarters. And both sides
kept making advances upon their opponents and retiring quickly, for
they were all cavalry. Thereupon Florentius, a Thracian, commanding a
detachment of horse, charged into the enemy's centre, and seizing the
general's standard, forced it to the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_15" id="PageI_xv_15">[15-21]</a></span> started to ride
back. And though he himself was overtaken and fell there, hacked to
pieces, he proved to be the chief cause of the victory for the Romans.
For when the barbarians no longer saw the standard, they were thrown
into great confusion and terror, and retreating, got inside their
camp, and remained quiet, having lost many men in the battle; and on
the following day they all returned homeward with no one following
them up, for it seemed to the Romans a great and very noteworthy thing
that such a great multitude of barbarians in their own country had
suffered those things which have just been narrated above, and that,
after making an invasion into hostile territory, they should retire
thus without accomplishing anything and defeated by a smaller force.</p>

<p>At that time the Romans also acquired certain Persian strongholds in
Persarmenia, both the fortress of Bolum and the fortress called
Pharangium, which is the place where the Persians mine gold, which
they take to the king. It happened also that a short time before this
they had reduced to subjection the Tzanic nation, who had been settled
from of old in Roman territory as an autonomous people; and as to
these things, the manner in which they were accomplished will be
related here and now.</p>

<p>As one goes from the land of Armenia into Persarmenia the Taurus lies
on the right, extending into Iberia and the peoples there, as has been
said a little before this,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" /><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> while on the left the road which
continues to descend for a great distance is overhung by exceedingly
precipitous mountains, concealed forever by clouds and snow, from
which the Phasis River<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_21" id="PageI_xv_21">[21-25]</a></span> issues and flows into the land of Colchis.
In this place from the beginning lived barbarians, the Tzanic nation,
subject to no one, called Sani in early times; they made plundering
expeditions among the Romans who lived round about, maintaining a most
difficult existence, and always living upon what they stole; for their
land produced for them nothing good to eat. Wherefore also the Roman
emperor sent them each year a fixed amount of gold, with the condition
that they should never plunder the country thereabout. And the
barbarians had sworn to observe this agreement with the oaths peculiar
to their nation, and then, disregarding what they had sworn, they had
been accustomed for a long time to make unexpected attacks and to
injure not only the Armenians, but also the Romans who lived next to
them as far as the sea; then, after completing their inroad in a short
space of time, they would immediately betake themselves again to their
homes. And whenever it <i>so</i> happened that they chanced upon a Roman
army, they were always defeated in the battle, but they proved to be
absolutely beyond capture owing to the strength of their fastnesses.
In this way Sittas had defeated them in battle before this war; and
then by many manifestations of kindness in word and in deed he had
been able to win them over completely. For they changed their manner
of life to one of a more civilized sort, and enrolled themselves among
the Roman troops, and from that time they have gone forth against the
enemy with the rest of the Roman army. They also abandoned their own
religion for a more righteous faith, and all of them became
Christians. Such then was the history of the Tzani.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_26" id="PageI_xv_26">[26-32]</a></span></p>


<p>Beyond the borders of this people there is a ca&ntilde;on whose walls are
both high and exceedingly steep, extending as far as the Caucasus
mountains. In it are populous towns, and grapes and other fruits grow
plentifully. And this ca&ntilde;on for about the space of a three days'
journey is tributary to the Romans, but from there begins the
territory of Persarmenia; and here is the gold-mine which, with the
permission of Cabades, was worked by one of the natives, Symeon by
name. When this Symeon saw that both nations were actively engaged in
the war, he decided to deprive Cabades of the revenue. Therefore he
gave over both himself and Pharangium to the Romans, but refused to
deliver over to either one the gold of the mine. And as for the
Romans, they did nothing, thinking it sufficient for them that the
enemy had lost the income from there, and the Persians were not able
against the will of the Romans to force the inhabitants of the place
to terms, because they were baffled by the difficult country.</p>

<p>At about the same time Narses and Aratius who at the beginning of this
war, as I have stated above,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" /><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> had an encounter with Sittas and
Belisarius in the land of the Persarmenians, came together with their
mother as deserters to the Romans; and the emperor's steward, Narses,
received them (for he too happened to be a Persarmenian by birth), and
he presented them with a large sum of money. When this came to the
knowledge of Isaac, their youngest brother, he secretly opened
negotiations with the Romans, and delivered over to them the fortress
of Bolum, which lies very near the limits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xv_32" id="PageI_xv_32">[32-4]</a></span> Theodosiopolis. For he
directed that soldiers should be concealed somewhere in the vicinity,
and he received them into the fort by night, opening stealthily one
small gate for them. Thus he too came to Byzantium.</p>
<br />
<p>XVI</p>

<p>Thus matters stood with the Romans. But the Persians, though defeated
by Belisarius in the battle at Daras, refused even so to retire from
there, until Rufinus, coming into the presence of Cabades, spoke as
follows: &quot;O King, I have been sent by thy brother, who reproaches thee
with a just reproach, because the Persians for no righteous cause have
come in arms into his land. But it would be more seemly for a king who
is not only mighty, but also wise as thou art, to secure a peaceful
conclusion of war, rather than, when affairs have been satisfactorily
settled, to inflict upon himself and his people unnecessary confusion.
Wherefore also I myself have come here with good hopes, in order that
from now on both peoples may enjoy the blessings which come from
peace.&quot; So spoke Rufinus. And Cabades replied as follows: &quot;O son of
Silvanus, by no means try to reverse the causes, understanding as you
do best of all men that you Romans have been the chief cause of the
whole confusion. For we have taken the Caspian Gates to the advantage
of both Persians and Romans, after forcing out the barbarians there,
since Anastasius, the Emperor of the Romans, as you yourself doubtless
know, when the opportunity was offered him to buy them with money, was
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvi_4" id="PageI_xvi_4">[4-8]</a></span>
willing to do so, in order that he might not be compelled to
squander great sums of money in behalf of both nations by keeping an
army there perpetually. And since that time we have stationed that
great army there, and have supported it up to the present time,
thereby giving you the privilege of inhabiting the land unplundered as
far as concerns the barbarians on that side, and of holding your own
possessions with complete freedom from trouble. But as if this were
not sufficient for you, you have also made a great city, Daras, as a
stronghold against the Persians, although this was explicitly
forbidden in the treaty which Anatolius arranged with the Persians;
and as a result of this it is necessary for the Persian state to be
afflicted with the difficulties and the expense of two armies, the one
in order that the Massagetae may not be able fearlessly to plunder the
land of both of us, and the other in order that we may check your
inroads. When lately we made a protest regarding these matters and
demanded that one of two things should be done by you, either that the
army sent to the Caspian Gates should be sent by both of us, or that
the city of Daras should be dismantled, you refused to understand what
was said, but saw fit to strengthen your plot against the Persians by
a greater injury, if we remember correctly the building of the fort in
Mindouos.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" />
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> And even now the
Romans may choose peace, or they may
elect war, by either doing justice to us or going against our rights.
For never will the Persians lay down their arms, until the Romans
either help them in guarding the gates, as is just and right, or
dismantle the city of Daras.&quot; With these words <span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvi_9" id="PageI_xvi_9">[9-5]</a></span>Cabades dismissed the ambassador, dropping the hint that he was
willing to take money from the Romans and have done with the causes of
the war. This was reported to the emperor by Rufinus when he came to
Byzantium. Hermogenes also came thither not long afterwards, and the
winter came to a close;
<span class="sidenote">531 A.D.</span>
thus ended the fourth year of the reign of the
Emperor Justinian.</p>
<br />
<p>XVII</p>

<p>At the opening of spring a Persian army under the leadership of
Azarethes invaded the Roman territory. They were fifteen thousand
strong, all horsemen. With them was Alamoundaras, son of Saccice, with
a very large body of Saracens. But this invasion was not made by the
Persians in the customary manner; for they did not invade Mesopotamia,
as formerly, but the country called Commagene of old, but now
Euphratesia, a point from which, as far as we know, the Persians never
before conducted a campaign against the Romans. But why the land was
called Mesopotamia and why the Persians refrained from making their
attack at this point is what I now propose to relate.</p>

<p>There is a mountain in Armenia which is not especially precipitous,
two-and-forty stades removed from Theodosiopolis and lying toward the
north from it. From this mountain issue two springs, forming
immediately two rivers, the one on the right called the Euphrates, and
the other the Tigris. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_5" id="PageI_xvii_5">[5-12]</a></span> these, the Tigris, descends, with no
deviations and with no tributaries except small ones emptying into it,
straight toward the city of Amida. And continuing into the country
which lies to the north of this city it enters the land of Assyria.
But the Euphrates at its beginning flows for a short distance, and is
then immediately lost to sight as it goes on; it does not, however,
become subterranean, but a very strange thing happens. For the water
is covered by a bog of great depth, extending about fifty stades in
length and twenty in breadth; and reeds grow in this mud in great
abundance. But the earth there is of such a hard sort that it seems to
those who chance upon it to be nothing else than solid ground, so that
both pedestrians and horsemen travel over it without any fear. Nay
more, even wagons pass over the place in great numbers every day, but
they are wholly insufficient to shake the bog or to find a weak spot
in it at any point. The natives burn the reeds every year, to prevent
the roads being stopped up by them, and once, when an exceedingly
violent wind struck the place, it came about that the fire reached the
extremities of the roots, and the water appeared at a small opening;
but in a short time the ground closed again, and gave the spot the
same appearance which it had had before. From there the river proceeds
into the land called Celesene, where was the sanctuary of Artemis
among the Taurians, from which they say Iphigenia, daughter of
Agamemnon, fled with Orestes and Pylades, bearing the statue of
Artemis. For the other temple which has existed even to my day in the
city of Comana is not the one &quot;Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_12" id="PageI_xvii_12">[12-18]</a></span> Taurians.&quot; But I shall
explain how this temple came into being.</p>

<p>When Orestes had departed in haste from the Taurians with his sister,
it so happened that he contracted some disease. And when he made
inquiry about the disease they say that the oracle responded that his
trouble would not abate until he built a temple to Artemis in a spot
such as the one among the Taurians, and there cut off his hair and
named the city after it. So then Orestes, going about the country
there, came to Pontus, and saw a mountain which rose steep and
towering, while below along the extremities of the mountain flowed the
river Iris. Orestes, therefore, supposing at that time that this was
the place indicated to him by the oracle, built there a great city and
the temple of Artemis, and, shearing off his hair, named after it the
city which even up to the present time has been called Comana. The
story goes on that after Orestes had done these things, the disease
continued to be as violent as before, if not even more so. Then the
man perceived that he was not satisfying the oracle by doing these
things, and he again went about looking everywhere and found a certain
spot in Cappadocia very closely resembling the one among the Taurians.
I myself have often seen this place and admired it exceedingly, and
have imagined that I was in the land of the Taurians. For this
mountain resembles the other remarkably, since the Taurus is here also
and the river Sarus is similar to the Euphrates there. So Orestes
built in that place an imposing city and two temples, the one to
Artemis<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_18" id="PageI_xvii_18">[18-24]</a></span> and the other to his sister Iphigenia, which the Christians
have made sanctuaries for themselves, without changing their structure
at all. This is called even now Golden Comana, being named from the
hair of Orestes, which they say he cut off there and thus escaped from
his affliction. But some say that this disease from which he escaped
was nothing else than that of madness which seized him after he had
killed his own mother. But I shall return to the previous narrative.</p>

<p>From Tauric Armenia and the land of Celesene the River Euphrates,
flowing to the right of the Tigris, flows around an extensive
territory, and since many rivers join it and among them the Arsinus,
whose copious stream flows down from the land of the so-called
Persarmenians, it becomes naturally a great river, and flows into the
land of the people anciently called White Syrians but now known as the
Lesser Armenians, whose first city, Melitene, is one of great
importance. From there it flows past Samosata and Hierapolis and all
the towns in that region as far as the land of Assyria, where the two
rivers unite with each other into one stream which bears the name of
the Tigris. The land which lies outside the River Euphrates, beginning
with Samosata, was called in ancient times Commagene, but now it is
named after the river.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" /><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But the land inside the river, that namely
which is between it and the Tigris, is appropriately named
Mesopotamia; however, a portion of it is called not only by this name,
but also by certain others. For the land as far as the city of Amida
has come to be called Armenia by some, while Edessa together with the
country<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_24" id="PageI_xvii_24">[24-30]</a></span> around it is called Osroene, after Osroes, a man who was
king in that place in former times, when the men of this country were
in alliance with the Persians. After the time, therefore, when the
Persians had taken from the Romans the city of Nisibis and certain
other places in Mesopotamia, whenever they were about to make an
expedition against the Romans, they disregarded the land outside the
River Euphrates, which was for the most part unwatered and deserted by
men, and gathered themselves here with no trouble, since they were in
a land which was their own and which lay very close to the inhabited
land of their enemy, and from here they always made their invasions.</p>

<p>When the mirranes,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" /><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> defeated in battle<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" /><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and with the greater
part of his men lost, came back to the Persian land with the remainder
of his army, he received bitter punishment at the hands of King
Cabades. For he took away from him a decoration which he was
accustomed to bind upon the hair of his head, an ornament wrought of
gold and pearls. Now this is a great dignity among the Persians,
second only to the kingly honour. For there it is unlawful to wear a
gold ring or girdle or brooch or anything else whatsoever, except a
man be counted worthy to do so by the king.</p>

<p>Thereafter Cabades began to consider in what manner he himself should
make an expedition against the Romans. For after the mirranes had
failed in the manner I have told, he felt confidence in no one else.
While he was completely at a loss as to what he should do,
Alamoundaras, the king of the Saracens, came before him and said: &quot;Not
everything, O Master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_30" id="PageI_xvii_30">[30-37]</a></span> should be entrusted to fortune, nor should
one believe that all wars ought to be successful. For this is not
likely and besides it is not in keeping with the course of human
events, but this idea is most unfortunate for those who are possessed
by it. For when men who expect that all the good things will come to
them fail at any time, if it so happen, they are distressed more than
is seemly by the very hope which wrongly led them on. Therefore, since
men have not always confidence in fortune, they do not enter into the
danger of war in a straightforward way, even if they boast that they
surpass the enemy in every respect, but by deception and divers
devices they exert themselves to circumvent their opponents. For those
who assume the risk of an even struggle have no assurance of victory.
Now, therefore, O King of Kings, neither be thus distressed by the
misfortune which has befallen Mirranes, nor desire again to make trial
of fortune. For in Mesopotamia and the land of Osroene, as it is
called, since it is very close to thy boundaries, the cities are very
strong above all others, and now they contain a multitude of soldiers
such as never before, so that if we go there the contest will not
prove a safe one; but in the land which lies outside the River
Euphrates, and in Syria which adjoins it, there is neither a fortified
city nor an army of any importance. For this I have often heard from
the Saracens sent as spies to these parts. There too, they say, is the
city of Antioch, in wealth and size and population the first of all
the cities of the Eastern Roman Empire; and this city is unguarded and
destitute of soldiers. For the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_37" id="PageI_xvii_37">[37-43]</a></span> of this city care for nothing
else than f&ecirc;tes and luxurious living, and their constant rivalries
with each other in the theatres. Accordingly, if we go against them
unexpectedly, it is not at all unlikely that we shall capture the city
by a sudden attack, and that we shall return to the land of the
Persians without having met any hostile army, and before the troops in
Mesopotamia have learned what has happened. As for lack of water or of
any kind of provisions, let no such thought occur to thee; for I
myself shall lead the army wherever it shall seem best.&quot;</p>

<p>
When Cabades heard this he could neither oppose nor distrust the plan.
For Alamoundaras was most discreet and well experienced in matters of
warfare, thoroughly faithful to the Persians, and unusually
energetic,&mdash;a man who for a space of fifty years forced the Roman
state to bend the knee. For beginning from the boundaries of Aegypt
and as far as Mesopotamia he plundered the whole country, pillaging
one place after another, burning the buildings in his track and making
captives of the population by the tens of thousands on each raid, most
of whom he killed without consideration, while he gave up the others
for great sums of money. And he was confronted by no one at all. For
he never made his inroad without looking about, but so suddenly did he
move and so very opportunely for himself, that, as a rule, he was
already off with all the plunder when the generals and the soldiers
were beginning to learn what had happened and to gather themselves
against him. If, indeed, by any chance, they were able to catch him,
this barbarian would fall upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xvii_43" id="PageI_xvii_43">[43-48]</a></span> pursuers while still unprepared
and not in battle array, and would rout and destroy them with no
trouble; and on one occasion he made prisoners of all the soldiers who
were pursuing him together with their officers. These officers were
Timostratus, the brother of Rufinus, and John, the son of Lucas, whom
he gave up indeed later, thereby gaining for himself no mean or
trivial wealth. And, in a word, this man proved himself the most
difficult and dangerous enemy of all to the Romans. The reason was
this, that Alamoundaras, holding the position of king, ruled alone
over all the Saracens in Persia, and he was always able to make his
inroad with the whole army wherever he wished in the Roman domain; and
neither any commander of Roman troops, whom they call &quot;duces,&quot; nor any
leader of the Saracens allied with the Romans, who are called
&quot;phylarchs,&quot; was strong enough with his men to array himself against
Alamoundaras; for the troops stationed in the different districts were
not a match in battle for the enemy.
<span class="sidenote">531 A.D.</span>
For this reason the Emperor
Justinian put in command of as many clans as possible Arethas, the son
of Gabalas, who ruled over the Saracens of Arabia, and bestowed upon
him the dignity of king, a thing which among the Romans had never
before been done. However Alamoundaras continued to injure the Romans
just as much as before, if not more, since Arethas was either
extremely unfortunate in every inroad and every conflict, or else he
turned traitor as quickly as he could. For as yet we know nothing
certain about him. In this way it came about that Alamoundaras, with
no one to stand against him, plundered the whole East for an
exceedingly long time, for he lived to a very advanced age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_1" id="PageI_xviii_1">[1-7]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>XVIII</p>

<p>This man's suggestion at that time therefore pleased Cabades, and he
chose out fifteen thousand men, putting in command of them Azarethes,
a Persian, who was an exceptionally able warrior, and he bade
Alamoundaras lead the expedition. So they crossed the River Euphrates
in Assyria, and, after passing over some uninhabited country, they
suddenly and unexpectedly threw their forces into the land of the
so-called Commagenae. This was the first invasion made by the Persians
from this point into Roman soil, as far as we know from tradition or
by any other means, and it paralyzed all the Romans with fear by its
unexpectedness. And when this news came to the knowledge of
Belisarius, at first he was at a loss, but afterwards he decided to go
to the rescue with all speed. So he established a sufficient garrison
in each city in order that Cabades with another hostile army might not
come there and find the towns of Mesopotamia utterly unguarded, and
himself with the rest of the army went to meet the invasion; and
crossing the River Euphrates they moved forward in great haste. Now
the Roman army amounted to about twenty thousand foot and horse, and
among them not less than two thousand were Isaurians. The commanders
of cavalry were all the same ones who had previously fought the battle
at Daras with Mirranes and the Persians, while the infantry were
commanded by one of the body-guards of the Emperor Justinian, Peter by
name. The Isaurians, however, were under the command of Longinus and
Stephanacius. Arethas also came<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_7" id="PageI_xviii_7">[7-15]</a></span> there to join them with the Saracen
army. When they reached the city of Chalcis, they encamped and
remained there, since they learned that the enemy were in a place
called Gabboulon, one hundred and ten stades away from Chalcis. When
this became known to Alamoundaras and Azarethes, they were terrified
at the danger, and no longer continued their advance, but decided to
retire homeward instantly. Accordingly they began to march back, with
the River Euphrates on the left, while the Roman army was following in
the rear. And in the spot where the Persians bivouacked each night the
Romans always tarried on the following night. For Belisarius purposely
refused to allow the army to make any longer march because he did not
wish to come to an engagement with the enemy, but he considered that
it was sufficient for them that the Persians and Alamoundaras, after
invading the land of the Romans, should retire from it in such a
fashion, betaking themselves to their own land without accomplishing
anything. And because of this all secretly mocked him, both officers
and soldiers, but not a man reproached him to his face.</p>

<p>Finally the Persians made their bivouac on the bank of the Euphrates
just opposite the city of Callinicus. From there they were about to
march through a country absolutely uninhabited by man, and thus to
quit the land of the Romans; for they purposed no longer to proceed as
before, keeping to the bank of the river. The Romans had passed the
night in the city of Sura, and, removing from there, they came upon
the enemy just in the act of preparing for the departure.

<span class="sidenote">Ap. 19, A.D.</span>
Now the
feast of Easter<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_15" id="PageI_xviii_15">[15-20]</a></span> was near and would take place on the following day;
this feast is reverenced by the Christians above all others, and on
the day before it they are accustomed to refrain from food and drink
not only throughout the day, but for a large part of the night also
they continue the fast. Then, therefore, Belisarius, seeing that all
his men were passionately eager to go against the enemy, wished to
persuade them to give up this idea (for this course had been
counselled by Hermogenes also, who had come recently on an embassy
from the emperor); he accordingly called together all who were present
and spoke as follows: &quot;O Romans, whither are you rushing? and what has
happened to you that you are purposing to choose for yourselves a
danger which is not necessary? Men believe that there is only one
victory which is unalloyed, namely to suffer no harm at the hands of
the enemy, and this very thing has been given us in the present
instance by fortune and by the fear of us that overpowers our foes.
Therefore it is better to enjoy the benefit of our present blessings
than to seek them when they have passed. For the Persians, led on by
many hopes, undertook an expedition against the Romans, and now, with
everything lost, they have beaten a hasty retreat. So that if we
compel them against their will to abandon their purpose of withdrawing
and to come to battle with us, we shall win no advantage whatsoever if
we are victorious,&mdash;for why should one rout a fugitive?&mdash;while if we
are unfortunate, as may happen, we shall both be deprived of the
victory which we now have, not robbed of it by the enemy, but flinging
it away ourselves, and also we shall abandon the land of the emperor
to lie open hereafter to the attacks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_20" id="PageI_xviii_20">[20-27]</a></span> the enemy without
defenders. Moreover this also is worth your consideration, that God is
always accustomed to succour men in dangers which are necessary, not
in those which they choose for themselves. And apart from this it will
come about that those who have nowhere to turn will play the part of
brave men even against their will, while the obstacles which are to be
met by us in entering the engagement are many; for a large number of
you have come on foot and all of us are fasting. I refrain from
mentioning that some even now have not arrived.&quot; So spoke Belisarius.</p>

<p>But the army began to insult him, not in silence nor with any
concealment, but they came shouting into his presence, and called him
weak and a destroyer of their zeal; and even some of the officers
joined with the soldiers in this offence, thus displaying the extent
of their daring. And Belisarius, in astonishment at their
shamelessness, changed his exhortation and now seemed to be urging
them on against the enemy and drawing them up for battle, saying that
he had not known before their eagerness to fight, but that now he was
of good courage and would go against the enemy with a better hope. He
then formed the phalanx with a single front, disposing his men as
follows: on the left wing by the river he stationed all the infantry,
while on the right where the ground rose sharply he placed Arethas and
all his Saracens; he himself with the cavalry took his position in the
centre. Thus the Romans arrayed themselves. And when Azarethes saw the
enemy gathering in battle line, he exhorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_27" id="PageI_xviii_27">[27-33]</a></span> his men with the
following words: &quot;Persians as you are, no one would deny that you
would not give up your valour in exchange for life, if a choice of the
two should be offered. But I say that not even if you should wish, is
it within your power to make the choice between the two. For as for
men who have the opportunity to escape from danger and live in
dishonour it is not at all unnatural that they should, if they wish,
choose what is most pleasant instead of what is best; but for men who
are bound to die, either gloriously at the hands of the enemy or
shamefully led to punishment by your Master, it is extreme folly not
to choose what is better instead of what is most shameful. Now,
therefore, when things stand thus, I consider that it befits you all
to bear in mind not only the enemy but also your own Lord and so enter
this battle.&quot;</p>

<p>After Azarethes also had uttered these words of exhortation, he
stationed the phalanx opposite his opponents, assigning the Persians
the right wing and the Saracens the left. Straightway both sides began
the fight, and the battle was exceedingly fierce. For the arrows, shot
from either side in very great numbers, caused great loss of life in
both armies, while some placed themselves in the interval between the
armies and made a display of valorous deeds against each other, and
especially among the Persians they were falling by the arrows in great
numbers. For while their missiles were incomparably more frequent,
since the Persians are almost all bowmen and they learn to make their
shots much more rapidly than any other men, still the bows which sent
the arrows were weak and not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_33" id="PageI_xviii_33">[33-38]</a></span> tightly strung, so that their
missiles, hitting a corselet, perhaps, or helmet or shield of a Roman
warrior, were broken off and had no power to hurt the man who was hit.
The Roman bowmen are always slower indeed, but inasmuch as their bows
are extremely stiff and very tightly strung, and one might add that
they are handled by stronger men, they easily slay much greater
numbers of those they hit than do the Persians, for no armour proves
an obstacle to the force of their arrows. Now already two-thirds of
the day had passed, and the battle was still even. Then by mutual
agreement all the best of the Persian army advanced to attack the
Roman right wing, where Arethas and the Saracens had been stationed.
But they broke their formation and moved apart, so that they got the
reputation of having betrayed the Romans to the Persians. For without
awaiting the oncoming enemy they all straightway beat a hasty retreat.
So the Persians in this way broke through the enemy's line and
immediately got in the rear of the Roman cavalry. Thus the Romans, who
were already exhausted both by the march and the labour of the
battle,&mdash;and besides this they were all fasting so far on in the
day,&mdash;now that they were assailed by the enemy on both sides, held out
no longer, but the most of them in full flight made their way to the
islands in the river which were close by, while some also remained
there and performed deeds both amazing and remarkable against the
enemy. Among these was Ascan who, after killing many of the notables
among the Persians, was gradually hacked to pieces and finally fell,
leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_38" id="PageI_xviii_38">[38-44]</a></span> to the enemy abundant reason to remember him. And with him
eight hundred others perished after shewing themselves brave men in
this struggle, and almost all the Isaurians fell with their leaders,
without even daring to lift their weapons against the enemy. For they
were thoroughly inexperienced in this business, since they had
recently left off farming and entered into the perils of warfare,
which before that time were unknown to them. And yet just before these
very men had been most furious of all for battle because of their
ignorance of warfare, and were then reproaching Belisarius with
cowardice. They were not in fact all Isaurians but the majority of
them were Lycaones.</p>

<p>Belisarius with some few men remained there, and as long as he saw
Ascan and his men holding out, he also in company with those who were
with him held back the enemy; but when some of Ascan's troops had
fallen, and the others had turned to flee wherever they could, then at
length he too fled with his men and came to the phalanx of infantry,
who with Peter were still fighting, although not many in number now,
since the most of them too had fled. There he himself gave up his
horse and commanded all his men to do the same thing and on foot with
the others to fight off the oncoming enemy. And those of the Persians
who were following the fugitives, after pursuing for only a short
distance, straightway returned and rushed upon the infantry and
Belisarius with all the others. Then the Romans turned their backs to
the river so that no movement to surround them might be executed by
the enemy, and as best they could under the circumstances were
defending themselves against<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_44" id="PageI_xviii_44">[44-52]</a></span> their assailants. And again the battle
became fierce, although the two sides were not evenly matched in
strength; for foot-soldiers, and a very few of them, were fighting
against the whole Persian cavalry. Nevertheless the enemy were not
able either to rout them or in any other way to overpower them. For
standing shoulder to shoulder they kept themselves constantly massed
in a small space, and they formed with their shields a rigid,
unyielding barricade, so that they shot at the Persians more
conveniently than they were shot at by them. Many a time after giving
up, the Persians would advance against them determined to break up and
destroy their line, but they always retired again from the assault
unsuccessful. For their horses, annoyed by the clashing of the
shields, reared up and made confusion for themselves and their riders.
Thus both sides continued the struggle until it had become late in the
day. And when night had already come on, the Persians withdrew to
their camp, and Belisarius accompanied by some few men found a
freight-boat and crossed over to the island in the river, while the
other Romans reached the same place by swimming. On the following day
many freight-boats were brought to the Romans from the city of
Callinicus and they were conveyed thither in them, and the Persians,
after despoiling the dead, all departed homeward. However they did not
find their own dead less numerous than the enemy's.</p>

<p>When Azarethes reached Persia with his army, although he had prospered
in the battle, he found Cabades exceedingly ungrateful, for the
following reason. It is a custom among the Persians that, when they
are about to march against any of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xviii_52" id="PageI_xviii_52">[52-56]</a></span> foes, the king sits on the
royal throne, and many baskets are set there before him; and the
general also is present who is expected to lead the army against the
enemy; then the army passes along before the king, one man at a time,
and each of them throws one weapon into the baskets; after this they
are sealed with the king's seal and preserved; and when this army
returns to Persia, each one of the soldiers takes one weapon out of
the baskets. A count is then made by those whose office it is to do so
of all the weapons which have not been taken by the men, and they
report to the king the number of the soldiers who have not returned,
and in this way it becomes evident how many have perished in the war.
Thus the law has stood from of old among the Persians. Now when
Azarethes came into the presence of the king, Cabades enquired of him
whether he came back with any Roman fortress won over to their side,
for he had marched forth with Alamoundaras against the Romans, with
the purpose of subduing Antioch. And Azarethes said that he had
captured no fortress, but that he had conquered the Romans and
Belisarius in battle. So Cabades bade the army of Azarethes pass by,
and from the baskets each man took out a weapon just as was customary.
But since many weapons were left, Cabades rebuked Azarethes for the
victory and thereafter ranked him among the most unworthy. So the
victory had this conclusion for Azarethes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_1" id="PageI_xix_1">[1-7]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>XIX</p>

<p>At that time the idea occurred to the Emperor Justinian to ally with
himself the Aethiopians and the Homeritae, in order to injure the
Persians. I shall now first explain what part of the earth these
nations occupy, and then I shall point out in what manner the emperor
hoped that they would be of help to the Romans. The boundaries of
Palestine extend toward the east to the sea which is called the Red
Sea. Now this sea, beginning at India, comes to an end at this point
in the Roman domain. And there is a city called Aelas on its shore,
where the sea comes to an end, as I have said, and becomes a very
narrow gulf. And as one sails into the sea from there, the Egyptian
mountains lie on the right, extending toward the south; on the other
side a country deserted by men extends northward to an indefinite
distance; and the land on both sides is visible as one sails in as far
as the island called Iotabe, not less than one thousand stades distant
from the city of Aelas. On this island Hebrews had lived from of old
in autonomy, but in the reign of this Justinian they have become
subject to the Romans. From there on there comes a great open sea. And
those who sail into this part of it no longer see the land on the
right, but they always anchor along the left coast when night comes
on. For it is impossible to navigate in the darkness on this sea,
since it is everywhere full of shoals. But there are harbours there
and great numbers of them, not made by the hand of man, but by the
natural contour of the land, and for this reason it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_7" id="PageI_xix_7">[7-16]</a></span>
difficult for mariners to find anchorage wherever they happen to be.</p>

<p>This coast<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" /><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> immediately beyond the boundaries of Palestine is held
by Saracens, who have been settled from of old in the Palm Groves.
These groves are in the interior, extending over a great tract of
land, and there absolutely nothing else grows except palm trees. The
Emperor Justinian had received these palm groves as a present from
Abochorabus, the ruler of the Saracens there, and he was appointed by
the emperor captain over the Saracens in Palestine. And he guarded the
land from plunder constantly, for both to the barbarians over whom he
ruled and no less to the enemy, Abochorabus always seemed a man to be
feared and an exceptionally energetic fellow. Formally, therefore, the
emperor holds the Palm Groves, but for him really to possess himself
of any of the country there is utterly impossible.
For a land
completely destitute of human habitation and extremely dry lies
between, extending to the distance of a ten days' journey; moreover
the Palm Groves themselves are by no means worth anything, and
Abochorabus only gave the form of a gift, and the emperor accepted it
with full knowledge of the fact. So much then for the Palm Groves.
Adjoining this people there are other Saracens in possession of the
coast, who are called Maddeni and who are subjects of the Homeritae.
These Homeritae dwell in the land on the farther side of them on the
shore of the sea. And beyond them many other nations are said to be
settled as far as the man-eating Saracens. Beyond these are the
nations of India. But regarding these matters let each one speak as he
may wish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_17" id="PageI_xix_17">[17-24]</a></span></p>

<p>About opposite the Homeritae on the opposite mainland dwell the
Aethiopians who are called Auxomitae, because their king resides in
the city of Auxomis. And the expanse of sea which lies between is
crossed in a voyage of five days and nights, when a moderately
favouring wind blows. For here they are accustomed to navigate by
night also, since there are no shoals at all in these parts; this
portion of the sea has been called the Red Sea by some. For the sea
which one traverses beyond this point as far as the shore and the city
of Aelas has received the name of the Arabian Gulf, inasmuch as the
country which extends from here to the limits of the city of Gaza used
to be called in olden times Arabia, since the king of the Arabs had
his palace in early times in the city of Petrae. Now the harbour of
the Homeritae from which they are accustomed to put to sea for the
voyage to Aethiopia is called Bulicas; and at the end of the sail
across the sea they always put in at the harbour of the Adulitae. But
the city of Adulis is removed from the harbour a distance of twenty
stades (for it lacks only so much of being on the sea), while from the
city of Auxomis it is a journey of twelve days.</p>

<p>All the boats which are found in India and on this sea are not made in
the same manner as are other ships. For neither are they smeared with
pitch, nor with any other substance, nor indeed are the planks
fastened together by iron nails going through and through, but they
are bound together with a kind of cording. The reason is not as most
persons suppose, that there are certain rocks there which draw the
iron to themselves (for witness the fact that when the Roman vessels
sail from Aelas into this sea, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_24" id="PageI_xix_24">[24-29]</a></span> they are fitted with much
iron, no such thing has ever happened to them), but rather because the
Indians and the Aethiopians possess neither iron nor any other thing
suitable for such purposes. Furthermore, they are not even able to buy
any of these things from the Romans since this is explicitly forbidden
to all by law; for death is the punishment for one who is caught. Such
then is the description of the so-called Red Sea<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" /><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and of the land
which lies on either side of it.</p>

<p>From the city of Auxomis to the Aegyptian boundaries of the Roman
domain, where the city called Elephantine is situated, is a journey of
thirty days for an unencumbered traveller. Within that space many
nations are settled, and among them the Blemyes and the Nobatae, who
are very large nations. But the Blemyes dwell in the central portion
of the country, while the Nobatae possess the territory about the
River Nile. Formerly this was not the limit of the Roman empire, but
it lay beyond there as far as one would advance in a seven days'
journey; but the Roman Emperor Diocletian came there, and observed
that the tribute from these places was of the smallest possible
account, since the land is at that point extremely narrow (for rocks
rise to an exceedingly great height at no great distance from the Nile
and spread over the rest of the country), while a very large body of
soldiers had been stationed there from of old, the maintenance of
which was an excessive burden upon the public; and at the same time
the Nobatae who formerly dwelt about the city of Oasis used to plunder
the whole region; so he persuaded these barbarians to move from
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_29" id="PageI_xix_29">[29-35]</a></span> own habitations, and to settle along the River Nile,
promising to bestow upon them great cities and land both extensive and
incomparably better than that which they had previously occupied. For
in this way he thought that they would no longer harass the country
about Oasis at least, and that they would possess themselves of the
land given them, as being their own, and would probably beat off the
Blemyes and the other barbarians. And since this pleased the Nobatae,
they made the migration immediately, just as Diocletian directed them,
and took possession of all the Roman cities and the land on both sides
of the river beyond the city of Elephantine. Then it was that this
emperor decreed that to them and to the Blemyes a fixed sum of gold
should be given every year with the stipulation that they should no
longer plunder the land of the Romans. And they receive this gold even
up to my time, but none the less they overrun the country there. Thus
it seems that with all barbarians there is no means of compelling them
to keep faith with the Romans except through the fear of soldiers to
hold them in check. And yet this emperor went so far as to select a
certain island in the River Nile close to the city of Elephantine and
there construct a very strong fortress in which he established certain
temples and altars for the Romans and these barbarians in common, and
he settled priests of both nations in this fortress, thinking that the
friendship between them would be secure by reason of their sharing the
things sacred to them. And for this reason he named the place Philae.
Now both these nations, the Blemyes and the Nobatae, believe in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xix_35" id="PageI_xix_35">[35-2]</a></span>
the gods in which the Greeks believe, and they also reverence Isis and
Osiris, and not least of all Priapus. But the Blemyes are accustomed
also to sacrifice human beings to the sun. These sanctuaries in Philae
were kept by these barbarians even up to my time, but the Emperor
Justinian decided to tear them down. Accordingly Narses, a
Persarmenian by birth, whom I have mentioned before as having deserted
to the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" /><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> being commander of the troops there, tore down the
sanctuaries at the emperor's order, and put the priests under guard
and sent the statues to Byzantium. But I shall return to the previous
narrative.</p>
<br />
<p>XX</p>

<p>At about the time of this war Hellestheaeus, the king of the
Aethiopians, who was a Christian and a most devoted adherent of this
faith, discovered that a number of the Homeritae on the opposite
main-land were oppressing the Christians there outrageously; many of
these rascals were Jews, and many of them held in reverence the old
faith which men of the present day call Hellenic. He therefore
collected a fleet of ships and an army and came against them, and he
conquered them in battle and slew both the king and many of the
Homeritae. He then set up in his stead a Christian king, a Homerite by
birth, by name Esimiphaeus, and, after ordaining that he should pay a
tribute to the Aethiopians every year, he returned to his home. In
this Aethiopian army many slaves and all who were readily disposed to
crime were quite unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xx_2" id="PageI_xx_2">[2-8]</a></span> to follow the king back, but were left
behind and remained there because of their desire for the land of the
Homeritae; for it is an extremely goodly land.</p> <p>These fellows at a time
not long after this, in company with certain others, rose against the
king Esimiphaeus and put him in confinement in one of the fortresses
there, and established another king over the Homeritae, Abramus by
name. Now this Abramus was a Christian, but a slave of a Roman citizen
who was engaged in the business of shipping in the city of Adulis in
Aethiopia. When Hellestheaeus learned this, he was eager to punish
Abramus together with those who had revolted with him for their
injustice to Esimiphaeus, and he sent against them an army of three
thousand men with one of his relatives as commander. This army, once
there, was no longer willing to return home, but they wished to remain
where they were in a goodly land, and so without the knowledge of
their commander they opened negotiations with Abramus; then when they
came to an engagement with their opponents, just as the fighting
began, they killed their commander and joined the ranks of the enemy,
and so remained there. But Hellestheaeus was greatly moved with anger
and sent still another army against them; this force engaged with
Abramus and his men, and, after suffering a severe defeat in the
battle, straightway returned home. Thereafter the king of the
Aethiopians became afraid, and sent no further expeditions against
Abramus. After the death of Hellestheaeus, Abramus agreed to pay
tribute to the king of the Aethiopians who succeeded him, and in this
way he strengthened his rule. But this happened at a later time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xx_9" id="PageI_xx_9">[9-12]</a></span></p>


<p>At that time, when Hellestheaeus was reigning over the Aethiopians,
and Esimiphaeus over the Homeritae, the Emperor Justinian sent an
ambassador, Julianus, demanding that both nations on account of their
community of religion should make common cause with the Romans in the
war against the Persians; for he purposed that the Aethiopians, by
purchasing silk from India and selling it among the Romans, might
themselves gain much money, while causing the Romans to profit in only
one way, namely, that they be no longer compelled to pay over their
money to their enemy. (This is the silk of which they are accustomed
to make the garments which of old the Greeks called Medic, but which
at the present time they name &quot;seric&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" /><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>). As for the Homeritae, it
was desired that they should establish Ca&iuml;sus, the fugitive, as
captain over the Maddeni, and with a great army of their own people
and of the Maddene Saracens make an invasion into the land of the
Persians. This Ca&iuml;sus was by birth of the captain's rank and an
exceptionally able warrior, but he had killed one of the relatives of
Esimiphaeus and was a fugitive in a land which is utterly destitute of
human habitation. So each king, promising to put this demand into
effect, dismissed the ambassador, but neither one of them did the
things agreed upon by them. For it was impossible for the Aethiopians
to buy silk from the Indians, for the Persian merchants always locate
themselves at the very harbours where the Indian ships first put in,
(since they inhabit the adjoining country), and are accustomed to buy
the whole cargoes; and it seemed to the Homeritae a difficult thing to
cross a country which was a desert and which extended so far that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xx_12" id="PageI_xx_12">[12-6]</a></span>
long time was required for the journey across it, and then to go
against a people much more warlike than themselves. Later on Abramus
too, when at length he had established his power most securely,
promised the Emperor Justinian many times to invade the land of
Persia, but only once began the journey and then straightway turned
back. Such then were the relations which the Romans had with the
Aethiopians and the Homeritae.</p>
<br />
<p>XXI</p>

<p>Hermogenes, as soon as the battle on the Euphrates had taken place,
came before Cabades to negotiate with him, but he accomplished nothing
regarding the peace on account of which he had come, since he found
him still swelling with rage against the Romans; for this reason he
returned unsuccessful. And Belisarius came to Byzantium at the summons
of the emperor, having been removed from the office which he held, in
order that he might march against the Vandals; but Sittas, as had been
decreed by the Emperor Justinian, went to the East in order to guard
that portion of the empire. And the Persians once more invaded
Mesopotamia with a great army under command of Chanaranges and
Aspebedes and Mermeroes. Since no one dared to engage with them, they
made camp and began the siege of Martyropolis, where Bouzes and Bessas
had been stationed in command of the garrison. This city lies in the
land called Sophanene, two hundred and forty stades distant from the
city of Amida toward the north; it is just on the River Nymphius
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxi_6" id="PageI_xxi_6">[6-13]</a></span> divides the land of the Romans and the Persians. So the
Persians began to assail the fortifications, and, while the besieged
at first withstood them manfully, it did not seem likely that they
would hold out long. For the circuit-wall was quite easily assailable
in most parts, and could be captured very easily by a Persian siege,
and besides they did not have a sufficient supply of provisions, nor
indeed had they engines of war nor anything else that was of any value
for defending themselves. Meanwhile Sittas and the Roman army came to
a place called Attachas, one hundred stades distant from Martyropolis,
but they did not dare to advance further, but established their camp
and remained there. Hermogenes also was with them, coming again as
ambassador from Byzantium. At this point the following event took
place.</p>

<p>It has been customary from ancient times both among the Romans and the
Persians to maintain spies at public expense; these men are accustomed
to go secretly among the enemy, in order that they may investigate
accurately what is going on, and may then return and report to the
rulers. Many of these men, as is natural, exert themselves to act in a
spirit of loyalty to their nation, while some also betray their
secrets to the enemy. At that time a certain spy who had been sent
from the Persians to the Romans came into the presence of the Emperor
Justinian and revealed many things which were taking place among the
barbarians, and, in particular, that the nation of the Massagetae, in
order to injure the Romans, were on the very point of going out into
the land of Persia, and that from there they were prepared to march
into the territory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxi_13" id="PageI_xxi_13">[13-20]</a></span> Romans, and unite with the Persian army.
When the emperor heard this, having already a proof of the man's
truthfulness to him, he presented him with a handsome sum of money and
persuaded him to go to the Persian army which was besieging the
Martyropolitans, and announce to the barbarians there that these
Massagetae had been won over with money by the Roman emperor, and were
about to come against them that very moment. The spy carried out these
instructions, and coming to the army of the barbarians he announced to
Chanaranges and the others that an army of Huns hostile to them would
at no distant time come to the Romans. And when they heard this, they
were seized with terror, and were at a loss how to deal with the
situation.</p>

<p>At this juncture it came about that Cabades became seriously ill, and
he called to him one of the Persians who were in closest intimacy with
him, Mebodes by name, and conversed with him concerning Chosroes and
the kingdom, and said he feared the Persians would make a serious
attempt to disregard some of the things which had been decided upon by
him. But Mebodes asked him to leave the declaration of his purpose in
writing, and bade him be confident that the Persians would never dare
to disregard it. So Cabades set it down plainly that Chosroes should
become king over the Persians. The document was written by Mebodes
himself, and Cabades immediately passed from among men. <span class="sidenote">Sept. 13, 531</span>And when
everything had been performed as prescribed by law in the burial of
the king, then Caoses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxi_20" id="PageI_xxi_20">[20-26]</a></span> confident by reason of the law, tried to lay
claim to the office, but Mebodes stood in his way, asserting that no
one ought to assume the royal power by his own initiative but by vote
of the Persian notables. So Caoses committed the decision in the
matter to the magistrates, supposing that there would be no opposition
to him from there. But when all the Persian notables had been gathered
together for this purpose and were in session, Mebodes read the
document and stated the purpose of Cabades regarding Chosroes, and
all, calling to mind the virtue of Cabades, straightway declared
Chosroes King of the Persians.</p>

<p>Thus then Chosroes secured the power. But at Martyropolis, Sittas and
Hermogenes were in fear concerning the city, since they were utterly
unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the
enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: &quot;It has
escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle
to the king of the Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each
state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in
order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle
the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly
as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the
ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both
peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute
concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually
accomplished at no distant date.&quot; Such were the words of the
ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to
them from the palace, who brought them word that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxi_26" id="PageI_xxi_26">[26-3]</a></span> Cabades had died
and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians,
and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And as a
result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly,
since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore
straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of
Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made
their departure promptly. And the Huns not long afterward invaded the
land of the Romans, but since they did not find the Persian army
there, they made their raid a short one, and then all departed
homeward.</p>
<br />
<p>XXII</p>

<p>Straightway Rufinus and Alexander and Thomas came to act as
ambassadors with Hermogenes, and they all came before the Persian king
at the River Tigris. And when Chosroes saw them, he released the
hostages. Then the ambassadors coaxed Chosroes, and spoke many
beguiling words most unbecoming to Roman ambassadors. By this
treatment Chosroes became tractable, and agreed to establish a peace
with them that should be without end for the price of one hundred and
ten &quot;centenaria,&quot; on condition that the commander of troops in
Mesopotamia should be no longer at Daras, but should spend all his
time in Constantina, as was customary in former times; but the
fortresses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxii_3" id="PageI_xxii_3">[3-11]</a></span> Lazica he refused to give back, although he himself
demanded that he should receive back from the Romans both Pharangium
and the fortress of Bolum. (Now the &quot;centenarium&quot; weighs one hundred
pounds, for which reason it is so called; for the Romans call one
hundred &quot;centum&quot;). He demanded that this gold be given him, in order
that the Romans might not be compelled either to tear down the city of
Daras or to share the garrison at the Caspian Gates with the
Persians.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" /><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> However the ambassadors, while approving the rest, said
that they were not able to concede the fortresses, unless they should
first make enquiry of the emperor concerning them. It was decided,
accordingly, that Rufinus should be sent concerning them to Byzantium,
and that the others should wait until he should return. And it was
arranged with Rufinus that seventy days' time be allowed until he
should arrive. When Rufinus reached Byzantium and reported to the
emperor what Chosroes' decision was concerning the peace, the emperor
commanded that the peace be concluded by them on these terms.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, a report which was not true reached Persia
saying that the Emperor Justinian had become enraged and put Rufinus
to death. Chosroes indeed was much perturbed by this, and, already
filled with anger, he advanced against the Romans with his whole army.
But Rufinus met him on the way as he was returning not far from the
city of Nisibis. Therefore they proceeded to this city themselves,
and, since they were about to establish the peace, the ambassadors
began to convey the money thither. But the Emperor Justinian was
already repenting that he had given up the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxii_11" id="PageI_xxii_11">[11-16]</a></span> holds of Lazica,
and he wrote a letter to the ambassadors expressly commanding them by
no means to hand them over to the Persians. For this reason Chosroes
no longer saw fit to make the treaty; and then it came to the mind of
Rufinus that he had counselled more speedily than safely in bringing
the money into the land of Persia. Straightway, therefore, he threw
himself on the earth, and lying prone he entreated Chosroes to send
the money back with them and not march immediately against the Romans,
but to put off the war to some other time. And Chosroes bade him rise
from the ground, promising that he would grant all these things. So
the ambassadors with the money came to Daras and the Persian army
marched back.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">532 A.D.</span>
Then indeed the fellow-ambassadors of Rufinus began to regard him with
extreme suspicion themselves, and they also denounced him to the
emperor, basing their judgment on the fact that Chosroes had been
persuaded to concede him everything which he asked of him. However,
the emperor showed him no disfavour on account of this. At a time not
long after this Rufinus himself and Hermogenes were again sent to the
court of Chosroes, and they immediately came to agreement with each
other concerning the treaty, subject to the condition that both sides
should give back all the places which each nation had wrested from the
other in that war, and that there should no longer be any military
post in Daras; as for the Iberians, it was agreed that the decision
rested with them whether they should remain there in Byzantium or
return to their own fatherland. And there were many who remained, and
many also who returned to their ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxii_16" id="PageI_xxii_16">[16-4]</a></span> homes. Thus, then, they
concluded the so-called &quot;endless peace,&quot; when the Emperor Justinian
was already in the sixth year of his reign. And the Romans gave the
Persians Pharangium and the fortress of Bolum together with the money,
and the Persians gave the Romans the strongholds of Lazica. The
Persians also returned Dagaris to the Romans, and received in return
for him another man of no mean station. This Dagaris in later times
often conquered the Huns in battle when they had invaded the land of
the Romans, and drove them out; for he was an exceptionally able
warrior. Thus both sides in the manner described made secure the
treaty between them.</p>
<br />
<p>XXIII</p>

<p>Straightway it came about that plots were formed against both rulers
by their subjects; and I shall now explain how this happened.
Chosroes, the son of Cabades, was a man of an unruly turn of mind and
strangely fond of innovations. For this reason he himself was always
full of excitement and alarms, and he was an unfailing cause of
similar feelings in all others. All, therefore, who were men of action
among the Persians, in vexation at his administration, were purposing
to establish over themselves another king from the house of Cabades.
And since they longed earnestly for the rule of Zames, which was made
impossible by the law by reason of the disfigurement of his eye, as
has been stated, they found upon consideration that the best course
for them was to establish in power his child<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiii_4" id="PageI_xxiii_4">[4-10]</a></span> Cabades, who bore the
same name as his grandfather, while Zames, as guardian of the child,
should administer the affairs of the Persians as he wished. So they
went to Zames and disclosed their plan, and, urging him on with great
enthusiasm, they endeavoured to persuade him to undertake the thing.
And since the plan pleased him, they were purposing to assail Chosroes
at the fitting moment. But the plan was discovered and came to the
knowledge of the king, and thus their proceedings were stopped. For
Chosroes slew Zames himself and all his own brothers and those of
Zames together with all their male offspring, and also all the Persian
notables who had either begun or taken part in any way in the plot
against him. Among these was Aspebedes, the brother of Chosroes'
mother.</p>

<p>Cabades, however, the son of Zames, he was quite unable to kill; for
he was still being reared under the chanaranges, Adergoudounbades. But
he sent a message to the chanaranges, bidding him himself kill the boy
he had reared; for he neither thought it well to shew mistrust, nor
yet had he power to compel him. The chanaranges, therefore, upon
hearing the commands of Chosroes, was exceedingly grieved and,
lamenting the misfortune, he communicated to his wife and Cabades'
nurse all that the king had commanded. Then the woman, bursting into
tears and seizing the knees of her husband, entreated him by no means
to kill Cabades. They therefore consulted together, and planned to
bring up the child in the most secure concealment, and to send word in
haste to Chosroes that Cabades had been put out of the world for him.
And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiii_10" id="PageI_xxiii_10">[10-15]</a></span> sent word to the king to this effect, and concealed
Cabades in such a way that the affair did not come to the notice of
any one, except Varrames, their own child, and one of the servants who
seemed to them to be in every way most trustworthy. But when, as time
went on, Cabades came of age, the chanaranges began to fear lest what
had been done should be brought to light; he therefore gave Cabades
money and bade him depart and save himself by flight wherever he
could. At that time, then, Chosroes and all the others were in
ignorance of the fact that the chanaranges had carried this thing
through.</p>

<p>At a later time Chosroes was making an invasion into the land of
Colchis with a great army, as will be told in the following
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" /><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And he was followed by the son of this same
chanaranges, Varrames, who took with him a number of his servants, and
among them the one who shared with him the knowledge of what had
happened to Cabades; while there Varrames told the king everything
regarding Cabades, and he brought forward the servant agreeing with
him in every particular. When Chosroes learned this he was forthwith
exceedingly angry, and he counted it a dreadful thing that he had
suffered such things at the hand of a man who was his slave; and since
he had no other means of getting the man under his hand he devised the
following plan. When he was about to return homeward from the land of
Colchis, he wrote to this chanaranges that he had decided to invade
the land of the Romans with his whole army, not, however, by a single
inroad into the country, but making two divisions of the Persian army,
in order that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiii_15" id="PageI_xxiii_15">[15-21]</a></span> attack might be made upon the enemy on both sides
of the River Euphrates. Now one division of the army he himself, as
was natural, would lead into the hostile land, while to no one else of
his subjects would he grant the privilege of holding equal honour with
the king in this matter, except to the chanaranges himself on account
of his valour. It was necessary, therefore, that the chanaranges
should come speedily to meet him as he returned, in order that he
might confer with him and give him all the directions which would be
of advantage to the army, and that he should bid his attendants travel
behind him on the road. When the chanaranges received this message, he
was overjoyed at the honour shown him by the king, and in complete
ignorance of his own evil plight, he immediately carried out the
instructions. But in the course of this journey, since he was quite
unable to sustain the toil of it (for he was a very old man), he
relaxed his hold on the reins and fell off his horse, breaking the
bone in his leg. It was therefore necessary for him to remain there
quietly and be cared for, and the king came to that place and saw him.
And Chosroes said to him that with his leg in such a plight it was not
possible that he make the expedition with them, but that he must go to
one of the fortresses in that region and receive treatment there from
the physicians. Thus then Chosroes sent the man away on the road to
death, and behind him followed the very men who were to destroy him in
the fortress,&mdash;a man who was in fact as well as in name an invincible
general among the Persians, who had marched against twelve nations of
barbarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiii_21" id="PageI_xxiii_21">[21-28]</a></span> and subjected them all to King Cabades. After
Adergoudounbades had been removed from the world, Varrames, his son,
received the office of chanaranges. Not long after this either Cabades
himself, the son of Zames, or someone else who was assuming the name
of Cabades came to Byzantium; certainly he resembled very closely in
appearance Cabades, the king. And the Emperor Justinian, though in
doubt concerning him, received him with great friendliness and
honoured him as the grandson of Cabades. So then fared the Persians
who rose against Chosroes.</p>

<p>Later on Chosroes destroyed also Mebodes for the following reason.
While the king was arranging a certain important matter, he directed
Zaberganes who was present to call Mebodes. Now it happened that
Zaberganes was on hostile terms with Mebodes. When he came to him, he
found him marshalling the soldiers under his command, and he said that
the king summoned him to come as quickly as possible. And Mebodes
promised that he would follow directly as soon as he should have
arranged the matter in hand; but Zaberganes, moved by his hostility to
him, reported to Chosroes that Mebodes did not wish to come at
present, claiming to have some business or other. Chosroes, therefore,
moved with anger, sent one of his attendants commanding Mebodes to go
to the tripod. Now as to what this is I shall explain forthwith. An
iron tripod stands always before the palace; and whenever anyone of
the Persians learns that the king is angry with him, it is not right
for such a man to flee for refuge to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiii_28" id="PageI_xxiii_28">[28-4]</a></span> sanctuary nor to go
elsewhere, but he must seat himself by this tripod and await the
verdict of the king, while no one at all dares protect him. There
Mebodes sat in pitiable plight for many days, until he was seized and
put to death at the command of Chosroes. Such was the final outcome of
his good deeds to Chosroes.</p>
<br />
<p>XXIV</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">Jan. 1, 532</span>
At this same time an insurrection broke out unexpectedly in Byzantium
among the populace, and, contrary to expectation, it proved to be a
very serious affair, and ended in great harm to the people and to the
senate, as the following account will shew. In every city the
population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the
Green factions; but within comparatively recent times it has come
about that, for the sake of these names and the seats which the rival
factions occupy in watching the games, they spend their money and
abandon their bodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think
it unworthy to die a most shameful death. And they fight against their
opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves, but
knowing well that, even if they overcome their enemy in the fight, the
conclusion of the matter for them will be to be carried off
straightway to the prison, and finally, after suffering extreme
torture, to be destroyed. So there grows up in them against their
fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it
cease or disappear, for it gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_4" id="PageI_xxiv_4">[4-8]</a></span> place neither to the ties of
marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the
same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be
brothers or any other kin. They care neither for things divine nor
human in comparison with conquering in these struggles; and it matters
not whether a sacrilege is committed by anyone at all against God, or
whether the laws and the constitution are violated by friend or by
foe; nay even when they are perhaps ill supplied with the necessities
of life, and when their fatherland is in the most pressing need and
suffering unjustly, they pay no heed if only it is likely to go well
with their &quot;faction&quot;; for so they name the bands of partisans. And
even women join with them in this unholy strife, and they not only
follow the men, but even resist them if opportunity offers, although
they neither go to the public exhibitions at all, nor are they
impelled by any other cause; so that I, for my part, am unable to call
this anything except a disease of the soul. This, then, is pretty well
how matters stand among the people of each and every city.</p>

<p>But at this time the officers of the city administration in Byzantium
were leading away to death some of the rioters. But the members of the
two factions, conspiring together and declaring a truce with each
other, seized the prisoners and then straightway entered the prison
and released all those who were in confinement there, whether they had
been condemned on a charge of stirring up sedition, or for any other
unlawful act. And all the attendants in the service of the city
government were killed indiscriminately; meanwhile, all of the
citizens who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_8" id="PageI_xxiv_8">[8-13]</a></span> sane-minded were fleeing to the opposite
mainland, and fire was applied to the city as if it had fallen under
the hand of an enemy. The sanctuary of Sophia and the baths of
Zeuxippus, and the portion of the imperial residence from the
propylaea as far as the so-called House of Ares were destroyed by
fire, and besides these both the great colonnades which extended as
far as the market place which bears the name of Constantine, in
addition to many houses of wealthy men and a vast amount of treasure.
During this time the emperor and his consort with a few members of the
senate shut themselves up in the palace and remained quietly there.
Now the watch-word which the populace passed around to one another was
Nika,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" /><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the insurrection has been called by this name up to the
present time.</p>

<p>The praetorian prefect at that time was John the Cappadocian, and
Tribunianus, a Pamphylian by birth, was counsellor to the emperor;
this person the Romans call &quot;quaestor.&quot; One of these two men, John,
was entirely without the advantages of a liberal education; for he
learned nothing while attending the elementary school except his
letters, and these, too, poorly enough; but by his natural ability he
became the most powerful man of whom we know. For he was most capable
in deciding upon what was needful and in finding a solution for
difficulties. But he became the basest of all men and employed his
natural power to further his low designs; neither consideration for
God nor any shame before man entered into his mind, but to destroy the
lives of many men for the sake of gain and to wreck whole cities was
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_13" id="PageI_xxiv_13">[13-18]</a></span> constant concern. So within a short time indeed he had acquired
vast sums of money, and he flung himself completely into the sordid
life of a drunken scoundrel; for up to the time of lunch each day he
would plunder the property of his subjects, and for the rest of the
day occupy himself with drinking and with wanton deeds of lust. And he
was utterly unable to control himself, for he ate food until he
vomited, and he was always ready to steal money and more ready to
bring it out and spend it. Such a man then was John. Tribunianus, on
the other hand, both possessed natural ability and in educational
attainments was inferior to none of his contemporaries; but he was
extraordinarily fond of the pursuit of money and always ready to sell
justice for gain; therefore every day, as a rule, he was repealing
some laws and proposing others, selling off to those who requested it
either favour according to their need.</p>

<p>Now as long as the people were waging this war with each other in
behalf of the names of the colours, no attention was paid to the
offences of these men against the constitution; but when the factions
came to a mutual understanding, as has been said, and so began the
sedition, then openly throughout the whole city they began to abuse
the two and went about seeking them to kill. Accordingly the emperor,
wishing to win the people to his side, instantly dismissed both these
men from office. And Phocas, a patrician, he appointed praetorian
prefect, a man of the greatest discretion and fitted by nature to be a
guardian of justice; Basilides he commanded to fill the office of
quaestor, a man known among the patricians for his agreeable qualities
and a notable besides. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_18" id="PageI_xxiv_18">[18-24]</a></span> the insurrection continued no less
violently under them. Now on the fifth day of the insurrection in the
late afternoon the Emperor Justinian gave orders to Hypatius and
Pompeius, nephews of the late emperor, Anastasius, to go home as
quickly as possible, either because he suspected that some plot was
being matured by them against his own person, or, it may be, because
destiny brought them to this. But they feared that the people would
force them to the throne (as in fact fell out), and they said that
they would be doing wrong if they should abandon their sovereign when
he found himself in such danger. When the Emperor Justinian heard
this, he inclined still more to his suspicion, and he bade them quit
the palace instantly. Thus, then, these two men betook themselves to
their homes, and, as long as it was night, they remained there
quietly.</p>

<p>But on the following day at sunrise it became known to the people that
both men had quit the palace where they had been staying. So the whole
population ran to them, and they declared Hypatius emperor and
prepared to lead him to the market-place to assume the power. But the
wife of Hypatius, Mary, a discreet woman, who had the greatest
reputation for prudence, laid hold of her husband and would not let
go, but cried out with loud lamentation and with entreaties to all her
kinsmen that the people were leading him on the road to death. But
since the throng overpowered her, she unwillingly released her
husband, and he by no will of his own came to the Forum of
Constantine, where they summoned him to the throne; then since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_24" id="PageI_xxiv_24">[24-30]</a></span>
had neither diadem nor anything else with which it is customary for a
king to be clothed, they placed a golden necklace upon his head and
proclaimed him Emperor of the Romans. By this time the members of the
senate were assembling,&mdash;as many of them as had not been left in the
emperor's residence,&mdash;and many expressed the opinion that they should
go to the palace to fight. But Origenes, a man of the senate, came
forward and spoke as follows: &quot;Fellow Romans, it is impossible that
the situation which is upon us be solved in any way except by war. Now
war and royal power are agreed to be the greatest of all things in the
world. But when action involves great issues, it refuses to be brought
to a successful conclusion by the brief crisis of a moment, but this
is accomplished only by wisdom of thought and energy of action, which
men display for a length of time. Therefore if we should go out
against the enemy, our cause will hang in the balance, and we shall be
taking a risk which will decide everything in a brief space of time;
and, as regards the consequences of such action, we shall either fall
down and worship Fortune or reproach her altogether. For those things
whose issue is most quickly decided, fall, as a rule, under the sway
of fortune. But if we handle the present situation more deliberately,
not even if we wish shall we be able to take Justinian in the palace,
but he will very speedily be thankful if he is allowed to flee; for
authority which is ignored always loses its power, since its strength
ebbs away with each day. Moreover we have other palaces, both
Placillianae and the palace named from Helen, which this emperor
should<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_30" id="PageI_xxiv_30">[30-36]</a></span> make his headquarters and from there he should carry on the
war and attend to the ordering of all other matters in the best
possible way.&quot; So spoke Origenes. But the rest, as a crowd is
accustomed to do, insisted more excitedly and thought that the present
moment was opportune, and not least of all Hypatius (for it was fated
that evil should befall him) bade them lead the way to the hippodrome.
But some say that he came there purposely, being well-disposed toward
the emperor.</p>

<p>Now the emperor and his court were deliberating as to whether it would
be better for them if they remained or if they took to flight in the
ships. And many opinions were expressed favouring either course. And
the Empress Theodora also spoke to the following effect: &quot;As to the
belief that a woman ought not to be daring among men or to assert
herself boldly among those who are holding back from fear, I consider
that the present crisis most certainly does not permit us to discuss
whether the matter should be regarded in this or in some other way.
For in the case of those whose interests have come into the greatest
danger nothing else seems best except to settle the issue immediately
before them in the best possible way. My opinion then is that the
present time, above all others, is inopportune for flight, even though
it bring safety. For while it is impossible for a man who has seen the
light not also to die, for one who has been an emperor it is
unendurable to be a fugitive. May I never be separated from this
purple, and may I not live that day on which those who meet me shall
not address me as mistress. If, now, it is your wish to save yourself,
O Emperor, there is no difficulty. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_37" id="PageI_xxiv_37">[37-43]</a></span> we have much money, and
there is the sea, here the boats. However consider whether it will not
come about after you have been saved that you would gladly exchange
that safety for death. For as for myself, I approve a certain ancient
saying that royalty is a good burial-shroud.&quot; When the queen had
spoken thus, all were filled with boldness, and, turning their
thoughts towards resistance, they began to consider how they might be
able to defend themselves if any hostile force should come against
them. Now the soldiers as a body, including those who were stationed
about the emperor's court, were neither well disposed to the emperor
nor willing openly to take an active part in fighting, but were
waiting for what the future would bring forth. All the hopes of the
emperor were centred upon Belisarius and Mundus, of whom the former,
Belisarius, had recently returned from the Persian war bringing with
him a following which was both powerful and imposing, and in
particular he had a great number of spearmen and guards who had
received their training in battles and the perils of warfare. Mundus
had been appointed general of the Illyrians, and by mere chance had
happened to come under summons to Byzantium on some necessary errand,
bringing with him Erulian barbarians.</p>

<p>When Hypatius reached the hippodrome, he went up immediately to where
the emperor is accustomed to take his place and seated himself on the
royal throne from which the emperor was always accustomed to view the
equestrian and athletic contests. And from the palace Mundus went out
through the gate which, from the circling descent, has been given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_44" id="PageI_xxiv_44">[44-50]</a></span>
the name of the Snail. Belisarius meanwhile began at first to go
straight up toward Hypatius himself and the royal throne, and when he
came to the adjoining structure where there has been a guard of
soldiers from of old, he cried out to the soldiers commanding them to
open the door for him as quickly as possible, in order that he might
go against the tyrant. But since the soldiers had decided to support
neither side, until one of them should be manifestly victorious, they
pretended not to hear at all and thus put him off. So Belisarius
returned to the emperor and declared that the day was lost for them,
for the soldiers who guarded the palace were rebelling against him.
The emperor therefore commanded him to go to the so-called Bronze Gate
and the propylaea there. So Belisarius, with difficulty and not
without danger and great exertion, made his way over ground covered by
ruins and half-burned buildings, and ascended to the stadium. And when
he had reached the Blue Colonnade which is on the right of the
emperor's throne, he purposed to go against Hypatius himself first;
but since there was a small door there which had been closed and was
guarded by the soldiers of Hypatius who were inside, he feared lest
while he was struggling in the narrow space the populace should fall
upon him, and after destroying both himself and all his followers,
should proceed with less trouble and difficulty against the emperor.
Concluding, therefore, that he must go against the populace who had
taken their stand in the hippodrome&mdash;a vast multitude crowding each
other in great disorder&mdash;he drew his sword from its sheath and,
commanding the others to do likewise, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_50" id="PageI_xxiv_50">[50-56]</a></span> shout he advanced upon
them at a run. But the populace, who were standing in a mass and not
in order, at the sight of armoured soldiers who had a great reputation
for bravery and experience in war, and seeing that they struck out
with their swords unsparingly, beat a hasty retreat. Then a great
outcry arose, as was natural, and Mundus, who was standing not far
away, was eager to join in the fight,&mdash;for he was a daring and
energetic fellow&mdash;but he was at a loss as to what he should do under
the circumstances; when, however, he observed that Belisarius was in
the struggle, he straightway made a sally into the hippodrome through
the entrance which they call the Gate of Death. Then indeed from both
sides the partisans of Hypatius were assailed with might and main and
destroyed. When the rout had become complete and there had already
been great slaughter of the populace, Boraedes and Justus, nephews of
the Emperor Justinian, without anyone daring to lift a hand against
them, dragged Hypatius down from the throne, and, leading him in,
handed him over together with Pompeius to the emperor. And there
perished among the populace on that day more than thirty thousand. But
the emperor commanded the two prisoners to be kept in severe
confinement. Then, while Pompeius was weeping and uttering pitiable
words (for the man was wholly inexperienced in such misfortunes),
Hypatius reproached him at length and said that those who were about
to die unjustly should not lament. For in the beginning they had been
forced by the people against their will, and afterwards they had come
to the hippodrome with no thought of harming the emperor. And the
soldiers killed both<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxiv_56" id="PageI_xxiv_56">[56-4]</a></span> of them on the following day and threw their
bodies into the sea. The emperor confiscated all their property for
the public treasury, and also that of all the other members of the
senate who had sided with them. Later, however, he restored to the
children of Hypatius and Pompeius and to all others the titles which
they had formerly held, and as much of their property as he had not
happened to bestow upon his friends. This was the end of the
insurrection in Byzantium.</p>
<br />
<p>XXV</p>

<p>Tribunianus and John were thus deprived of office, but at a later time
they were both restored to the same positions. And Tribunianus lived
on in office many years and died of disease, suffering no further harm
from anyone. For he was a smooth fellow and agreeable in every way and
well able by the excellence of his education to throw into the shade
his affliction of avarice. But John was oppressive and severe alike
with all men, inflicting blows upon those whom he met and plundering
without respect absolutely all their money; consequently in the tenth
year of his office he rightly and justly atoned for his lawless
conduct in the following manner.</p>

<p>The Empress Theodora hated him above all others. And while he gave
offence to the woman by the wrongs he committed, he was not of a mind
to win her by flattery or by kindness in any way, but he openly set
himself in opposition to her and kept slandering her to the emperor,
neither blushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_4" id="PageI_xxv_4">[4-10]</a></span> before her high station nor feeling shame because
of the extraordinary love which the emperor felt for her. When the
queen perceived what was being done, she purposed to slay the man, but
in no way could she do this, since the Emperor Justinian set great
store by him. And when John learned of the purpose of the queen
regarding him, he was greatly terrified. And whenever he went into his
chamber to sleep, he expected every night that some one of the
barbarians would fall upon him to slay him; and he kept peeping out of
the room and looking about the entrances and remained sleepless,
although he had attached to himself many thousands of spearmen and
guards, a thing which had been granted to no prefect before that time.
But at daybreak, forgetting all his fears of things divine and human,
he would become again a plague to all the Romans both in public and in
private. And he conversed commonly with sorcerers, and constantly
listened to profane oracles which portended for him the imperial
office, so that he was plainly walking on air and lifted up by his
hopes of the royal power. But in his rascality and the lawlessness of
his conduct there was no moderation or abatement. And there was in him
absolutely no regard for God, and even when he went to a sanctuary to
pray and to pass the night, he did not do at all as the Christians are
wont to do, but he clothed himself in a coarse garment appropriate to
a priest of the old faith which they are now accustomed to call
Hellenic, and throughout that whole night mumbled out some unholy
words which he had practised, praying that the mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_10" id="PageI_xxv_10">[10-15]</a></span> the emperor
might be still more under his control, and that he himself might be
free from harm at the hands of all men.</p>

<p>At this time Belisarius, after subjugating Italy, came to Byzantium at
the summons of the emperor with his wife Antonina, in order to march
against the Persians<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" /><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. And while in the eyes of all others he was
an honoured and distinguished person, as was natural, John alone was
hostile to him and worked actively against him, for no other reason
than that he drew the hatred of all to himself, while Belisarius
enjoyed an unequalled popularity. And it was on him that the hope of
the Romans centred as he marched once more against the Persians,
leaving his wife in Byzantium. Now Antonina, the wife of Belisarius,
(for she was the most capable person in the world to contrive the
impossible,) purposing to do a favour to the empress, devised the
following plan. John had a daughter, Euphemia, who had a great
reputation for discretion, but a very young woman and for this reason
very susceptible; this girl was exceedingly loved by her father, for
she was his only child. By treating this young woman kindly for
several days Antonina succeeded most completely in winning her
friendship, and she did not refuse to share her secrets with her. And
on one occasion when she was present alone with her in her room she
pretended to lament the fate which was upon her, saying that although
Belisarius had made the Roman empire broader by a goodly measure than
it had been before, and though he had brought two captive kings and so
great an amount of wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_15" id="PageI_xxv_15">[15-21]</a></span> to Byzantium, he found Justinian
ungrateful; and in other respects she slandered the government as not
just. Now Euphemia was overjoyed by these words, for she too was
hostile to the present administration by reason of her fear of the
empress, and she said: &quot;And yet, dearest friend, it is you and
Belisarius who are to blame for this, seeing that, though you have
opportunity, you are not willing to use your power.&quot; And Antonina
replied quickly: &quot;It is because we are not able, my daughter, to
undertake revolutions in camp, unless some of those here at home join
with us in the task. Now if your father were willing, we should most
easily organize this project and accomplish whatever God wills.&quot; When
Euphemia heard this, she promised eagerly that the suggestion would be
carried out, and departing from there she immediately brought the
matter before her father. And he was pleased by the message (for he
inferred that this undertaking offered him a way to the fulfilment of
his prophecies and to the royal power), and straightway without any
hesitation he assented, and bade his child arrange that on the
following day he himself should come to confer with Antonina and give
pledges. When Antonina learned the mind of John, she wished to lead
him as far as possible astray from the understanding of the truth, so
she said that for the present it was inadvisable that he should meet
her, for fear lest some suspicion should arise strong enough to
prevent proceedings; but she was intending straightway to depart for
the East to join Belisarius. When, therefore, she had quit Byzantium
and had reached the suburb (the one called Rufinianae which was the
private possession of Belisarius), there John should<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_21" id="PageI_xxv_21">[21-27]</a></span> come as if to
salute her and to escort her forth on the journey, and they should
confer regarding matters of state and give and receive their pledges.
In saying this she seemed to John to speak well, and a certain day was
appointed to carry out the plan. And the empress, hearing the whole
account from Antonina, expressed approval of what she had planned, and
by her exhortations raised her enthusiasm to a much higher pitch
still.</p>

<p>When the appointed day was at hand, Antonina bade the empress farewell
and departed from the city, and she went to Rufinianae, as if to begin
on the following day her journey to the East; hither too came John at
night in order to carry out the plan which had been agreed upon.
Meanwhile the empress denounced to her husband the things which were
being done by John to secure the tyranny, and she sent Narses, the
eunuch, and Marcellus, the commander of the palace guards to
Rufinianae with numerous soldiers, in order that they might
investigate what was going on, and, if they found John setting about a
revolution, that they might kill the man forthwith and return. So
these departed for this task. But they say that the emperor got
information of what was being done and sent one of John's friends to
him forbidding him on any condition to meet Antonina secretly. But
John (since it was fated that he should fare ill), disregarding the
emperor's warning, about midnight met Antonina, close by a certain
wall behind which she had stationed Narses and Marcellus with their
men that they might hear what was said. There, while John with
unguarded tongue was assenting to the plans for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_27" id="PageI_xxv_27">[27-35]</a></span> attack and
binding himself with the most dread oaths, Narses and Marcellus
suddenly set upon him. But in the natural confusion which resulted the
body-guards of John (for they stood close by) came immediately to his
side. And one of them smote Marcellus with his sword, not knowing who
he was, and thus John was enabled to escape with them, and reached the
city with all speed. And if he had had the courage to go straightway
before the emperor, I believe that he would have suffered no harm at
his hand; but as it was, he fled for refuge to the sanctuary, and gave
the empress opportunity to work her will against him at her pleasure.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">May, 541</span>
Thus, then, from being prefect he became a private citizen, and rising
from that sanctuary he was conveyed to another, which is situated in
the suburb of the city of Cyzicus called by the Cyzicenes Artace.
There he donned the garb of a priest, much against his will, not a
bishop's gown however, but that of a presbyter, as they are called.
But he was quite unwilling to perform the office of a priest lest at
some time it should be a hindrance to his entering again into office;
for he was by no means ready to relinquish his hopes. All his property
was immediately confiscated to the public treasury, but a large
proportion of this the emperor remitted to him, for he was still
inclined to spare him. There it was possible for John to live,
disregarding all dangers and enjoying great wealth, both that which he
himself had concealed and that which by the decision of the emperor
remained with him, and to indulge in luxury at his pleasure, and, if
he had reasoned wisely, to consider his present lot a happy one. For
this reason all the Romans were exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_35" id="PageI_xxv_35">[35-42]</a></span> vexed with the man,
because, forsooth, after proving himself the basest of all demons,
contrary to his deserts he was leading a life happier than before. But
God, I think, did not suffer John's retribution to end thus, but
prepared for him a greater punishment. And it fell out thus.</p>

<p>There was in Cyzicus a certain bishop named Eusebius, a man harsh to
all who came in his way, and no less so than John; this man the
Cyzicenes denounced to the emperor and summoned to justice. And since
they accomplished nothing inasmuch as Eusebius circumvented them by
his great power, certain youths agreed together and killed him in the
market-place of Cyzicus. Now it happened that John had become
especially hostile to Eusebius, and hence the suspicion of the plot
fell upon him. Accordingly men were sent from the senate to investigate
this act of pollution. And these men first confined John in a prison,
and then this man who had been such a powerful prefect, and had been
inscribed among the patricians and had mounted the seat of the
consuls, than which nothing seems greater, at least in the Roman
state, they made to stand naked like any robber or footpad, and
thrashing him with many blows upon his back, compelled him to tell his
past life. And while John had not been clearly convicted as guilty of
the murder of Eusebius, it seemed that God's justice was exacting from
him the penalties of the world. Thereafter they stripped him of all
his goods and put him naked on board a ship, being wrapped in a single
cloak, and that a very rough one purchased for<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxv_42" id="PageI_xxv_42">[42-4]</a></span> some few obols; and
wherever the ship anchored, those who had him in charge commanded him
to ask from those he met bread or obols. Thus begging everywhere along
the way he was conveyed to the city of Antinous in Aegypt. And this is
now the third year during which they have been guarding him there in
confinement. As for John himself, although he has fallen into such
troubles, he has not relinquished his hope of royal power, but he made
up his mind to denounce certain Alexandrians as owing money to the
public treasury. Thus then John the Cappadocian ten years afterward
was overtaken by this punishment for his political career.</p>
<br />
<p>XXVI</p>

<p>At that time the Emperor again designated Belisarius General of the
East, and, sending him to Libya, gained over the country, as will be
told later on in my narrative. When this information came to Chosroes
and the Persians, they were mightily vexed, and they already repented
having made peace with the Romans, because they perceived that their
power was extending greatly. And Chosroes sent envoys to Byzantium,
and said that he rejoiced with the Emperor Justinian, and he asked
with a laugh to receive his share of the spoils from Libya, on the
ground that the emperor would never have been able to conquer in the
war with the Vandals if the Persians had not been at peace with him.
So then Justinian made a present of money to Chosroes, and not long
afterwards dismissed the envoys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxvi_5" id="PageI_xxvi_5">[5-11]</a></span></p>

<p>In the city of Daras the following event took place. There was a
certain John there serving in a detachment of infantry; this man, in
conspiracy with some few of the soldiers, but not all, took possession
of the city, essaying to make himself tyrant. Then he established
himself in a palace as if in a citadel, and was strengthening his
tyranny every day. And if it had not happened that the Persians were
continuing to keep peace with the Romans, irreparable harm would have
come from this affair to the Romans. But as it was, this was prevented
by the agreement which had already been reached, as I have said. On
the fourth day of the tyranny some soldiers conspired together, and by
the advice of Mamas, the priest of the city, and Anastasius, one of
the notable citizens, they went up to the palace at high noon, each
man hiding a small sword under his garment. And first at the door of
the courtyard they found some few of the body-guards, whom they slew
immediately. Then they entered the men's apartment and laid hold upon
the tyrant; but some say that the soldiers were not the first to do
this, but that while they were still hesitating in the courtyard and
trembling at the danger, a certain sausage-vendor who was with them
rushed in with his cleaver and meeting John smote him unexpectedly.
But the blow which had been dealt him was not a fatal one, this
account goes on to say, and he fled with a great outcry and suddenly
fell among these very soldiers. Thus they laid hands upon the man and
immediately set fire to the palace and burned it, in order that there

John<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_xxvi_11" id="PageI_xxvi_11">[11-12]</a></span> they led away to the prison and bound. And one of them,
fearing lest the soldiers, upon learning that the tyrant survived,
might again make trouble for the city, killed John, and in this way
stopped the confusion. Such, then, was the progress of events touching
this tyranny.</p>

<h3>THE PERSIAN WAR (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>
<br />
<br />
<p>I</p>
<p>Not long after this Chosroes, upon learning that Belisarius had begun
to win Italy also for the Emperor Justinian, was no longer able to
restrain his thoughts but he wished to discover pretexts, in order
that he might break the treaty on some grounds which would seem
plausible. And he conferred with Alamoundaras concerning this matter
and commanded him to provide causes for war. So Alamoundaras brought
against Arethas, the charge that he, Arethas, was doing him violence
in a matter of boundary lines, and he entered into conflict with him
in time of peace, and began to overrun the land of the Romans on this
pretext. And he declared that, as for him, he was not breaking the
treaty between the Persians and Romans, for neither one of them had
included him in it. And this was true. For no mention of Saracens was
ever made in treaties, on the ground that they were included under the
names of Persians and Romans. Now this country which at that time was
claimed by both tribes of Saracens<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33" /><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is called Strata, and extends to
the south of the city of Palmyra; nowhere does it produce a single
tree or any of the useful growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_i_6" id="PageII_i_6">[6-12]</a></span> corn-lands, for it is burned
exceedingly dry by the sun, but from of old it has been devoted to
the pasturage of some few flocks. Now Arethas maintained that the
place belonged to the Romans, proving his assertion by the name which
has long been applied to it by all (for Strata signifies &quot;a paved
road&quot; in the Latin tongue), and he also adduced the testimonies of men
of the oldest times. Alamoundaras, however, was by no means inclined
to quarrel concerning the name, but he claimed that tribute had been
given him from of old for the pasturage there by the owners of the
flocks. The Emperor Justinian therefore entrusted the settlement of
the disputed points to Strategius; a patrician and administrator of
the royal treasures, and besides a man of wisdom and of good ancestry,
and with him Summus, who had commanded the troops in Palestine. This
Summus was the brother of Julian, who not long before had served as
envoy to the Aethiopians and Homeritae. And the one of them, Summus,
insisted that the Romans ought not to surrender the country, but
Strategius begged of the emperor that he should not do the Persians
the favour of providing them with pretexts for the war which they
already desired, for the sake of a small bit of land and one of
absolutely no account, but altogether unproductive and unsuitable for
crops. The Emperor Justinian, therefore, took the matter under
consideration, and a long time was spent in the settlement of the
question.</p>

<p>But Chosroes, the King of the Persians, claimed that the treaty had
been broken by Justinian, who had lately displayed great opposition to
his house, in that he had attempted in time of peace to attach
Alamoundaras to himself. For, as he said, Summus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_i_12" id="PageII_i_12">[12-3]</a></span> who had recently
gone to the Saracen ostensibly to arrange matters, had hoodwinked him
by promises of large sums of money on condition that he should join
the Romans, and he brought forward a letter which, he alleged, the
Emperor Justinian had written to Alamoundaras concerning these things.
He also declared that he had sent a letter to some of the Huns, in
which he urged them to invade the land of the Persians and to do
extensive damage to the country thereabout. This letter he asserted to
have been put into his hands by the Huns themselves who had come
before him. So then Chosroes, with these charges against the Romans,
was purposing to break off the treaty. But as to whether he was
speaking the truth in these matters, I am not able to say.</p>
<br />
<p>II</p>

<p>At this point Vittigis, the leader of the Goths, already worsted in
the war, sent two envoys to him to persuade him to march against the
Romans; but the men whom he sent were not Goths, in order that the
real character of the embassy might not be at once obvious and so make
negotiations useless, but Ligurian priests who were attracted to this
enterprise by rich gifts of money. One of these men, who seemed to be
the more worthy, undertook the embassy assuming the pretended name of
bishop which did not belong to him at all, while the other followed as
his attendant. And when in the course of the journey they came to the
land of Thrace, they attached to themselves a man from there to
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ii_3" id="PageII_ii_3">[3-9]</a></span> an interpreter of the Syriac and the Greek tongues, and
without being detected by any of the Romans, they reached the land of
Persia. For inasmuch as they were at peace, they were not keeping a
strict guard over that region. And coming before Chosroes they spoke
as follows: &quot;It is true, O King, that all other envoys undertake their
task for the sake of advantages to themselves as a rule, but we have
been sent by Vittigis, the king of the Goths and the Italians, in
order to speak in behalf of thy kingdom; and consider that he is now
present before thee speaking these words. If anyone should say, O
King, putting all in a word, that thou hast given up thy kingdom and
all men everywhere to Justinian, he would be speaking correctly. For
since he is by nature a meddler and a lover of those things which in
no way belong to him, and is not able to abide by the settled order of
things, he has conceived the desire of seizing upon the whole earth,
and has become eager to acquire for himself each and every state.
Accordingly (since he was neither able alone to assail the Persians,
nor with the Persians opposing him to proceed against the others), he
decided to deceive thee with the pretence of peace, and by forcing the
others to subjection to acquire mighty forces against thy state.
Therefore, after having already destroyed the kingdom of the Vandals
and subjugated the Moors, while the Goths because of their friendship
stood aside for him, he has come against us bringing vast sums of
money and many men. Now it is evident that, if he is able also to
crush the Goths utterly, he will with us and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ii_9" id="PageII_ii_9">[9-15]</a></span> already enslaved
march against the Persians, neither considering the name of friendship
nor blushing before any of his sworn promises. While, therefore, some
hope of safety is still left thee, do not do us any further wrong nor
suffer it thyself, but see in our misfortunes what will a little later
befall the Persians; and consider that the Romans could never be
well-disposed to thy kingdom, and that when they become more
powerful, they will not hesitate at all to display their enmity toward
the Persians. Use, therefore, this good chance while the time fits,
lest thou seek for it after it has ceased. For when once the time of
opportunity has passed, it is not its nature to return again. And it
is better by anticipating to be in security, than by delaying beyond
the opportune time to suffer the most miserable fate possible at the
hands of the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>When Chosroes heard this, it seemed to him that Vittigis advised well,
and he was still more eager to break off the treaty. For, moved as he
was by envy toward the Emperor Justinian, he neglected completely to
consider that the words were spoken to him by men who were bitter
enemies of Justinian. But because he wished the thing he willingly
consented to be persuaded. And he did the very same thing a little
later in the case of the addresses of the Armenians and of the Lazi,
which will be spoken of directly. And yet they were bringing as
charges against Justinian the very things which would naturally be
encomiums for a worthy monarch, namely that he was exerting himself to
make his realm larger and much more splendid. For these accusations
one might make also against Cyrus, the King of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ii_15" id="PageII_ii_15">[15-6]</a></span> Persians, and
Alexander, the Macedonian. But justice is never accustomed to dwell
together with envy. For these reasons, then, Chosroes was purposing to
break off the treaty.</p>
<br />
<p>III</p>

<p>At this same time another event also occurred; it was as follows. That
Symeon who had given Pharangium into the hands of the Romans persuaded
the Emperor Justinian, while the war was still at its height, to
present him with certain villages of Armenia. And becoming master of
these places, he was plotted against and murdered by those who had
formerly possessed them. After this crime had been committed, the
perpetrators of the murder fled into the land of Persia. They were two
brothers, sons of Perozes. And when the Emperor heard this, he gave
over the villages to Amazaspes, the nephew of Symeon, and appointed
him ruler over the Armenians. This Amazaspes, as time went on, was
denounced to the Emperor Justinian by one of his friends, Acacius by
name, on the ground that he was abusing the Armenians and wished to
give over to the Persians Theodosiopolis and certain other
fortresses. After telling this, Acacius, by the emperor's will, slew
Amazaspes treacherously, and himself secured the command over the
Armenians by the gift of the emperor. And being base by nature, he
gained the opportunity of displaying his inward character, and he
proved to be the most cruel of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_6" id="PageII_iii_6">[6-14]</a></span> men toward his subjects. For he
plundered their property without excuse and ordained that they should
pay an unheard-of tax of four centenaria.<a name="FNanchor_2_34" id="FNanchor_2_34" /><a href="#Footnote_2_34" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the Armenians, unable
to bear him any longer, conspired together and slew Acacius and fled
for refuge to Pharangium.</p>

<p>Therefore the emperor sent Sittas against them from Byzantium. For
Sittas had been delaying there since the time when the treaty was made
with the Persians. So he came to Armenia, but at first he entered upon
the war reluctantly and exerted himself to calm the people and to
restore the population to their former habitations, promising to
persuade the emperor to remit to them the payment of the new tax. But
since the emperor kept assailing him with frequent reproaches for his
hesitation, led on by the slanders of Adolius, the son of
Acacius,
Sittas at last made his preparations for the conflict. First of all he
attempted by means of promises of many good things to win over some of
the Armenians by persuasion and to attach them to his cause, in order
that the task of overpowering the others might be attended with less
difficulty and toil. And the tribe called the Aspetiani, great in
power and in numbers, was willing to join him. And they went to Sittas
and begged him to give them pledges in writing that, if they abandoned
their kinsmen in the battle and came to the Roman army, they should
remain entirely free from harm, retaining their own possessions. Now
Sittas was delighted and wrote to them in tablets, giving them pledges
just as they desired of him; he then sealed the writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_14" id="PageII_iii_14">[14-21]</a></span> and sent it
to them. Then, confident that by their help he would be victorious in
the war without fighting, he went with his whole army to a place
called Oenochalakon, where the Armenians had their camp. But by some
chance those who carried the tablets went by another road and did not
succeed at all in meeting the Aspetiani. Moreover a portion of the
Roman army happened upon some few of them, and not knowing the
agreement which had been made, treated them as enemies. And Sittas
himself caught some of their women and children in a cave and slew
them, either because he did not understand what had happened or
because he was angry with the Aspetiani for not joining him as had
been agreed.</p>

<p>But they, being now possessed with anger, arrayed themselves for
battle with all the rest. But since both armies were on exceedingly
difficult ground where precipices abounded, they did not fight in one
place, but scattered about among the ridges and ravines. So it
happened that some few of the Armenians and Sittas with not many of
his followers came close upon each other, with only a ravine lying
between them. Both parties were horsemen. Then Sittas with a few men
following him crossed the ravine and advanced against the enemy; the
Armenians, after withdrawing to the rear, stopped, and Sittas pursued
no further but remained where he was. Suddenly someone from the Roman
army, an Erulian by birth, who had been pursuing the enemy, returning
impetuously from them came up to Sittas and his men. Now as it
happened Sittas had planted his spear in the ground; and the
Erulian's<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_21" id="PageII_iii_21">[21-28]</a></span> horse fell upon this with a great rush and shattered it.
And the general was exceedingly annoyed by this, and one of the
Armenians, seeing him, recognized him and declared to all the others
that it was Sittas. For it happened that he had no helmet on his head.
Thus it did not escape the enemy that he had come there with only a
few men. Sittas, then, upon hearing the Armenian say this, since his
spear, as has been said, lay broken in two on the ground, drew his
sword and attempted immediately to recross the ravine. But the enemy
advanced upon him with great eagerness, and a soldier overtaking him
in the ravine struck him a glancing blow with his sword on the top of
his head; and he took off the whole scalp, but the steel did not
injure the bone at all. And Sittas continued to press forward still
more than before, but Artabanes, son of John of the Arsacidae, fell
upon him from behind and with a thrust of his spear killed him. Thus
Sittas was removed from the world after no notable fashion, in a
manner unworthy of his valour and his continual achievements against
the enemy, a man who was extremely handsome in appearance and a
capable warrior, and a general second to none of his contemporaries.
But some say that Sittas did not die at the hand of Artabanes, but
that Solomon, a very insignificant man among the Armenians, destroyed
him.</p>

<p>After the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against
the Armenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to
effect a reconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and
asking that some of their notables should come to confer with him on
these matters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_28" id="PageII_iii_28">[28-34]</a></span> Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust
Bouzes nor were they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a
certain man of the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him,
John by name, the father of Artabanes, and this man, trusting in
Bouzes as his friend came to him with his son-in-law, Bassaces, and a
few others; but when these men had reached the spot where they were to
meet Bouzes on the following day, and had made their bivouac there,
they perceived that they had come into a place surrounded by the Roman
army. Bassaces, the son-in-law, therefore earnestly entreated John to
fly. And since he was not able to persuade him, he left him there
alone, and in company with all the others eluded the Romans, and went
back again by the same road. And Bouzes found John alone and slew him;
and since after this the Armenians had no hope of ever reaching an
agreement with the Romans, and since they were unable to prevail over
the emperor in war, they came before the Persian king led by Bassaces,
an energetic man. And the leading men among them came at that time
into the presence of Chosroes and spoke as follows: &quot;Many of us, O
Master, are Arsacidae, descendants of that Arsaces who was not
unrelated to the Parthian kings when the Persian realm lay under the
hand of the Parthians, and who proved himself an illustrious king,
inferior to none of his time. Now we have come to thee, and all of us
have become slaves and fugitives, not, however, of our own will, but
under most hard constraint, as it might seem by reason of the Roman
power, but in truth, O King, by reason of thy decision,&mdash;if, indeed,
he who gives the strength to those who wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_34" id="PageII_iii_34">[34-41]</a></span> do injustice should
himself justly bear also the blame of their misdeeds. Now we shall
begin our account from a little distance back in order that you may be
able to follow the whole course of events. Arsaces, the last king of
our ancestors, abdicated his throne willingly in favour of Theodosius,
the Roman Emperor, on condition that all who should belong to his
family through all time should live unhampered in every respect, and
in particular should in no case be subject to taxation. And we have
preserved the agreement, until you, the Persians, made this
much-vaunted treaty, which, as we think, one would not err in calling
a sort of common destruction. For from that time, disregarding friend
and foe, he who is in name thy friend, O King, but in fact thy enemy,
has turned everything in the world upside down and wrought complete
confusion. And this thou thyself shalt know at no distant time, as
soon as he is able to subdue completely the people of the West. For
what thing which was before forbidden has he not done? or what thing
which was well established has he not disturbed? Did he not ordain
for us the payment of a tax which did not exist before, and has he not
enslaved our neighbours, the Tzani, who were autonomous, and has he
not set over the king of the wretched Lazi a Roman magistrate?&mdash;an act
neither in keeping with the natural order of things nor very easy to
explain in words. Has he not sent generals to the men of Bosporus, the
subjects of the Huns, and attached to himself the city which in no way
belongs to him, and has he not made a defensive alliance with the
Aethiopian kingdoms, of which the Romans had never even heard? More
than this he has made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_41" id="PageII_iii_41">[41-49]</a></span> Homeritae his possession and the Red Sea,
and he is adding the Palm Groves to the Roman dominion. We omit to
speak of the fate of the Libyans and of the Italians. The whole earth
is not large enough for the man; it is too small a thing for him to
conquer all the world together. But he is even looking about the
heavens and is searching the retreats beyond the ocean, wishing to
gain for himself some other world. Why, therefore, O King, dost thou
still delay? Why dost thou respect that most accursed peace, in order
forsooth that he may make thee the last morsel of all? If it is thy
wish to learn what kind of a man Justinian would shew himself toward
those who yield to him, the example is to be sought near at hand from
ourselves and from the wretched Lazi; and if thou wishest to see how
he is accustomed to treat those who are unknown to him and who have
done him not the least wrong, consider the Vandals and the Goths and
the Moors. But the chief thing has not yet been spoken. Has he not
made efforts in time of peace to win over by deception thy slave,
Alamoundaras, O most mighty King, and to detach him from thy kingdom,
and has he not striven recently to attach to himself the Huns who are
utterly unknown to him, in order to make trouble for thee? And yet an
act more strange than this has not been performed in all time. For
since he perceived, as I think, that the overthrow of the western
world would speedily be accomplished, he has already taken in hand to
assail you of the East, since the Persian power alone has been left
for him to grapple with. The peace, therefore, as far as concerns him,
has already been broken for thee, and he himself has set an end to the
endless peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_50" id="PageII_iii_50">[50-57]</a></span>

For they break the peace, not who may be first in arms, but they who
may be caught plotting against their neighbours in time of peace. For
the crime has been committed by him who attempts it, even though
success be lacking. Now as for the course which the war will follow,
this is surely clear to everyone. For it is not those who furnish
causes for war, but those who defend themselves against those who
furnish them, who are accustomed always to conquer their enemies. Nay
more, the contest will not be evenly matched for us even in point of
strength. For, as it happens, the majority of the Roman soldiers are
at the end of the world, and as for the two generals who were the best
they had, we come here having slain the one, Sittas, and Belisarius
will never again be seen by Justinian. For disregarding his master, he
has remained in the West, holding the power of Italy himself. So that
when thou goest against the enemy, no one at all will confront thee,
and thou wilt have us leading the army with good will, as is natural,
and with a thorough knowledge of the country.&quot; When Chosroes heard
this he was pleased, and calling together all who were of noble blood
among the Persians, he disclosed to all of them what Vittigis had
written and what the Armenians had said, and laid before them the
question as to what should be done. Then many opinions were expressed
inclining to either side, but finally it was decided that they must
open hostilities against the Romans at the beginning of spring.
<span class="sidenote">539 A.D.</span>
For it
was the late autumn season, in the thirteenth year of the reign of the
Emperor Justinian. The Romans, however, did not suspect this, nor did
they think that the Persians would ever break the so-called endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iii_57" id="PageII_iii_57">[57-4]</a></span>
peace, although they heard that Chosroes blamed their emperor for his
successes in the West, and that he preferred against him the charges
which I have lately mentioned.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">539 A.D.</span>
At that time also the comet appeared, at first about as long as a tall
man, but later much larger. And the end of it was toward the west and
its beginning toward the east, and it followed behind the sun itself.
For the sun was in Capricorn and it was in Sagittarius. And some
called it &quot;the swordfish&quot; because it was of goodly length and very
sharp at the point, and others called it &quot;the bearded star&quot;; it was
seen for more than forty days. Now those who were wise in these
matters disagreed utterly with each other, and one announced that one
thing, another that another thing was indicated by this star; but I
only write what took place and I leave to each one to judge by the
outcome as he wishes. Straightway a mighty Hunnic army crossing the
Danube River fell as a scourge upon all Europe, a thing which had
happened many times before, but which had never brought such a
multitude of woes nor such dreadful ones to the people of that land.
For from the Ionian Gulf these barbarians plundered everything in
order as far as the suburbs of Byzantium. And they captured
thirty-two fortresses in Illyricum, and they carried by storm the city
of Cassandria (which the ancients called Potidaea, as far as we know),
never having fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iv_5" id="PageII_iv_5">[5-13]</a></span> against walls before. And taking with them the
money and leading away one hundred and twenty thousand captives, they
all retired homeward without encountering any opposition. In later
times too they often came there and brought upon the Romans
irreparable calamity. This same people also assailed the wall of the
Chersonesus, where they overpowered those who were defending
themselves from the wall, and approaching through the surf of the sea,
scaled the fortifications on the so-called Black Gulf; thus they got
within the long wall, and falling unexpectedly upon the Romans in the
Chersonesus they slew many of them and made prisoners of almost all
the survivors. Some few of them also crossed the strait between Sestus

and Abydus, and after plundering the Asiatic country, they returned
again to the Chersonesus, and with the rest of the army and all the
booty betook themselves to their homes. In another invasion they
plundered Illyricum and Thessaly and attempted to storm the wall at
Thermopylae; and since the guards on the walls defended them most
valiantly, they sought out the ways around and unexpectedly found the
path which leads up the mountain which rises there.<a name="FNanchor_3_35" id="FNanchor_3_35" /><a href="#Footnote_3_35" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In this way
they destroyed almost all the Greeks except the Peloponnesians, and
then withdrew. And the Persians not long afterwards broke off the
treaty and wrought such harm to the Romans of the East as I shall set
forth immediately.</p>

<p>Belisarius, after humbling Vittigis, the king of the Goths and
Italians, brought him alive to Byzantium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iv_13" id="PageII_iv_13">[13-21]</a></span> And I shall now proceed
to tell how the army of the Persians invaded the land of the Romans.
When the Emperor Justinian perceived that Chosroes was eager for war,
he wished to offer him some counsel and to dissuade him from the
undertaking. Now it happened that a certain man had come to Byzantium
from the city of Daras, Anastasius by name, well known for his
sagacity; he it was who had broken the tyranny which had been
established recently in Daras. Justinian therefore wrote a letter and
sent it by this Anastasius to Chosroes; and the message of the letter
was as follows: &quot;It is the part of men of discretion and those by
whom divine things are treated with due respect, when causes of war
arise, and in particular against men who are in the truest sense
friends, to exert all their power to put an end to them; but it
belongs to foolish men and those who most lightly bring on themselves
the enmity of Heaven to devise occasions for war and insurrection
which have no real existence. Now to destroy peace and enter upon war
is not a difficult matter, since the nature of things is such as to
make the basest activities easy for the most dishonourable men. But
when they have brought about war according to their intention, to
return again to peace is for men, I think, not easy. And yet thou
chargest me with writing letters which were not written with any dark
purpose, and thou hast now made haste to interpret these with
arbitrary judgment, not in the sense in which we conceived them when
we wrote them, but in a way which will be of advantage to thee in thy
eagerness to carry out thy plans not without some pretext. But for us
it is possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_iv_21" id="PageII_iv_21">[21-26]</a></span> point out that thy Alamoundaras recently overran
our land and performed outrageous deeds in time of peace, to wit, the
capture of towns, the seizure of property, the massacre and
enslavement of such a multitude of men, concerning which it will be
thy duty not to blame us, but to defend thyself. For the crimes of
those who have done wrong are made manifest to their neighbours by
their acts, not by their thoughts. But even with these things as they
are, we have still decided to hold to peace, but we hear that thou in
thy eagerness to make war upon the Romans art fabricating accusations
which do not belong to us at all. Natural enough, this; for while
those who are eager to preserve the present order of things repel even
those charges against their friends which are most pressing, those who
are not satisfied with established friendships exert themselves to
provide even pretexts which do not exist. But this would not seem to
be becoming even to ordinary men, much less to kings. But leaving
aside these things do thou consider the number of those who will be
destroyed on both sides in the course of the war, and consider well
who will justly bear the blame for those things which will come to
pass, and ponder upon the oaths which thou didst take when thou didst
carry away the money, and consider that if, after that, thou wrongly
dishonour them by some tricks or sophistries, thou wouldst not be able
to pervert them; for Heaven is too mighty to be deceived by any man.&quot;
When Chosroes saw this message, he neither made any immediate answer
nor did he dismiss Anastasius, but he compelled him to remain
there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_1" id="PageII_v_1">[1-6]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>V</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">540 A.D.</span>
When the winter was already reaching its close, and the thirteenth
year of the reign of the Emperor Justinian was ending, Chosroes, son
of Cabades, invaded the land of the Romans at the opening of spring
with a mighty army, and openly broke the so-called endless peace. But
he did not enter by the country between the rivers, but advanced with
the Euphrates on his right. On the other side of the river stands the
last Roman stronghold which is called Circesium, an exceedingly strong
place,
since the River Aborras, a large stream, has its mouth at this
point and mingles with the Euphrates, and this fortress lies exactly
in the angle which is made by the junction of the two rivers. And a
long second wall outside the fortress cuts off the land between the
two rivers, and completes the form of a triangle around Circesium.
Chosroes, therefore, not wishing to make trial of so strong a fortress
and not having in mind to cross the River Euphrates, but rather to go
against the Syrians and Cilicians, without any hesitation led his army
forward, and after advancing for what, to an unencumbered traveller,
is about a three-days' journey along the bank of the Euphrates, he
came upon the city of Zenobia; this place Zenobia had built in former
times, and, as was natural, she gave her name to the city. Now Zenobia
was the wife of Odonathus, the ruler of the Saracens of that region,
who had been on terms of peace with the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_6" id="PageII_v_6">[6-13]</a></span> from of old. This
Odonathus rescued for the Romans the Eastern Empire when it had come
under the power of the Medes; but this took place in former times.
Chosroes then came near to Zenobia, but upon learning that the place
was not important and observing that the land was untenanted and
destitute of all good things, he feared lest any time spent by him
there would be wasted on an affair of no consequence and would be a
hindrance to great undertakings, and he attempted to force the place
to surrender. But meeting with no success, he hastened his march
forward.</p>

<p>After again accomplishing a journey of equal extent, he reached the
city of Sura, which is on the River Euphrates, and stopped very close
to it. There it happened that the horse on which Chosroes was riding
neighed and stamped the ground with his foot. And the Magi considered
the meaning of this incident and announced that the place would be
captured. Chosroes then made camp and led his army against the
fortifications to assail the wall. Now it happened that a certain
Arsaces, an Armenian by birth, was commander of the soldiers in the
town; and he made the soldiers mount the parapets, and fighting from
there most valiantly slew many of the enemy, but was himself struck by
an arrow and died. And then, since it was late in the day, the
Persians retired to their camp in order to assail the wall again on
the following day; but the Romans were in despair since their leader
was dead, and were purposing to make themselves suppliants of
Chosroes. On the following day, therefore, they sent the bishop of the
city to plead for them and to beg that the town be<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_13" id="PageII_v_13">[13-18]</a></span> spared; so he
took with him some of his attendants, who carried fowls and wine and
clean loaves, and came before Chosroes; there he threw himself on the
ground, and with tears supplicated him to spare a pitiable population
and a city altogether without honour in the eyes of the Romans, and
one which in past times had never been of any account to the
Persians, and which never would be such thereafter; and he promised
that the men of Sura would give him ransom worthy of themselves and
the city which they inhabited. But Chosroes was angry with the
townsmen because, being the first he had met of all the Romans, they
had not willingly received him into their city, but even daring to
raise their arms against him had slain a large number of Persian
notables. However he did not disclose his anger, but carefully
concealed it behind a smooth countenance, in order that by carrying
out the punishment of the inhabitants of Sura he might make himself in
the eyes of the Romans a fearful person and one not to be resisted.
For by acting in this way he calculated that those who would from time
to time come in his way would yield to him without trouble.
Accordingly with great friendliness he caused the bishop to rise, and
receiving the gifts, gave the impression, in a way, that he would
immediately confer with the notables of the Persians concerning the
ransom of the townsmen, and would settle their request favourably.
Thus he dismissed the bishop and his following without any suspicion
of the plot, and he sent with him certain of the men of note among the
Persians, who were to be ostensibly an escort. These men he secretly
commanded to go with him as far as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_18" id="PageII_v_18">[18-25]</a></span> wall, encouraging him and
cheering him with fair hopes, so that he and all those with him should
be seen by those inside rejoicing and fearing nothing. But when the
guards had set the gate open and were about to receive them into the
city, they were to throw a stone or block of wood between the
threshold and the gate and not allow them to shut it, but should
themselves for a time stand in the way of those who wished to close
it; for not long afterwards the army would follow them.</p>

<p>After giving these directions to the men Chosroes made ready the army,
and commanded them to advance upon the city on the run whenever he
should give the signal. So when they came close to the fortifications,
the Persians bade farewell to the bishop and remained outside, and the
townsmen, seeing that the man was exceedingly happy and that he was
being escorted in great honour by the enemy, forgetting all their
difficulties opened the gate wide, and received the priest and his
following with clapping of hands and much shouting. And when all got
inside, the guards began to push the gate in order to close it, but
the Persians flung down a stone, which they had provided, between it
and the threshold. And the guards pushed and struggled still more, but
were quite unable to get the gate back to the threshold. On the other
hand they dared not open it again, since they perceived that it was
held by the enemy. But some say that it was not a stone but a block of
wood which the Persians threw into the gateway. When the townsmen had
as yet scarcely realized the plot, Chosroes was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_25" id="PageII_v_25">[25-31]</a></span> hand with his
whole army, and the barbarians forced back and flung open the gate,
which was soon carried by storm. Straightway, then, Chosroes, filled
with wrath, plundered the houses and put to death great numbers of the
population; all the remainder he reduced to slavery, and setting fire
to the whole city razed it to the ground. Then he dismissed
Anastasius, bidding him announce to the Emperor Justinian where in the
world he had left Chosroes, son of Cabades.</p>

<p>Afterwards either through motives of humanity or of avarice, or as
granting a favour to a woman whom he had taken as a captive from the
city, Euphemia by name, Chosroes decided to shew some kindness to the
inhabitants of Sura; for he had conceived for this woman an
extraordinary love (for she was exceedingly beautiful to look upon),
and had made her his wedded wife. He sent, accordingly, to
Sergiopolis, a city subject to the Romans, named from Sergius, a
famous saint, distant from the captured city one hundred and
twenty-six stades and lying to the south of it in the so-called
Barbarian Plain, and bade Candidus, the bishop of the city, purchase
the captives, twelve thousand in number, for two centenaria. But the
bishop, alleging that he had no money, refused absolutely to undertake
the matter. Chosroes therefore requested him to set down in a document
the agreement that he would give the money at a later time, and thus
to purchase for a small sum such a multitude of slaves. Candidus did
as directed, promising to give the money within a year, and swore the
most dire oaths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_v_31" id="PageII_v_31">[31-3]</a></span> specifying that he should receive the following
punishment if he should not give the money at the time agreed upon,
that he should pay double the amount and should himself be no longer a
priest, as one who had neglected his sworn promise. And after setting
down these things in writing, Candidus received all the inhabitants of
Sura. And some few among them survived, but the majority, unable to
support the misery which had fallen to their lot, succumbed soon
afterwards. After the settlement of this affair Chosroes led his army
forward.</p>
<br />
<p>VI</p>

<p>IT had happened a little before this that the emperor had divided into
two parts the military command of the East, leaving the portion as far
as the River Euphrates under the control of Belisarius who formerly
held the command of the whole, while the portion from there as far as
the Persian boundary he entrusted to Bouzes, commanding him to take
charge of the whole territory of the East until Belisarius should
return from Italy. Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis,
keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had
befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans
and spoke as follows: &quot;Whenever men are confronted with a struggle
against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it
is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict
with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vi_3" id="PageII_vi_3">[3-8]</a></span>
to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their
enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against
them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of
Chosroes is you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he
wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the
wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the
Persians will secure all they need from our land, where there will be
no one to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I
believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the
assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to
attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with
a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest
of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from
there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon
those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel
Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat
within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his
attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of
the necessities for so great an army.&quot; So spoke Bouzes; and in his
words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of
what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion
of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And
where in the world he was neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor
the hostile army was able to learn. Such, then, was the course of
these events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vi_9" id="PageII_vi_9">[9-15]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the
Persians, immediately sent his nephew Germanus with three hundred
followers in great disorder, promising that after no great time a
numerous army would follow. And Germanus, upon reaching Antioch, went
around the whole circuit of the wall; and the greater part of it he
found secure, for along that portion of it which lies on the level
ground the River Orontes flows, making it everywhere difficult of
access, and the portion which is on higher ground rises upon steep
hills and is quite inaccessible to the enemy; but when he attained the
highest point, which the men of that place are accustomed to call
Orocasias, he noticed that the wall at that point was very easy to
assail. For there happens to be in that place a rock, which spreads
out to a very considerable width, and rises to a height only a little
less than the fortifications. He therefore commanded that they should
either cut off the rock by making a deep ditch along the wall, lest
anyone should essay to mount from there upon the fortifications, or
that they should build upon it a great tower and connect its structure
with the wall of the city. But to the architects of public buildings
it seemed that neither one of these things should be done. For, as
they said, the work would not be completed in a short time with the
attack of the enemy so imminent, while if they began this work and
did not carry it to completion, they would do nothing else than shew
to the enemy at what point in the wall they should make their attack.
Germanus, though disappointed in this plan, had some hope at first
because he expected an army from Byzantium. But when, after
considerable time had passed, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vi_15" id="PageII_vi_15">[15-19]</a></span> army arrived from the emperor nor
was expected to arrive, he began to fear lest Chosroes, learning that
the emperor's nephew was there, would consider it more important than
any other thing to capture Antioch and himself, and for this reason
would neglect everything else and come against the city with his whole
army. The natives of Antioch also had these things in mind, and they
held a council concerning them, at which it seemed most advisable to
offer money to Chosroes and thus escape the present danger.</p>

<p>Accordingly they sent Megas, the bishop of Beroea, a man of discretion
who at that time happened to be tarrying among them, to beg for mercy
from Chosroes; and departing from there he came upon the Median army
not far from Hierapolis. And coming into the presence of Chosroes, he
entreated him earnestly to have pity upon men who had committed no
offence against him and who were not able to hold out against the
Persian army. For it was becoming to a king least of all men to
trample upon and do violence to those who retreated before him and
were quite unwilling to array themselves against him; for not one of
the things which he was then doing was a kingly or honourable act,
because, without affording any time for consideration to the Roman
emperor, so that he might either make the peace secure as might seem
well to both sovereigns, or make his preparations for war in
accordance with a mutual agreement, as was to be expected, he had thus
recklessly advanced in arms against the Romans, while their emperor
did not as yet know what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vi_19" id="PageII_vi_19">[19-1]</a></span> come upon them. When Chosroes heard
this, he was utterly unable by reason of his stupidity to order his
mind with reason and discretion, but still more than before he was
lifted up in spirit. He therefore threatened to destroy all the
Syrians and Cilicians, and bidding Megas follow him, he led his army
to Hierapolis. When he had come there and established his camp, since
he saw that the fortifications were strong and learned that the city
was well garrisoned with soldiers, he demanded money from the
Hierapolitans, sending to them Paulus as interpreter. This Paulus had
been reared in Roman territory and had gone to an elementary school in
Antioch, and besides he was said to be by birth of Roman extraction.
But in spite of everything the inhabitants were exceedingly fearful
for the fortifications, which embraced a large tract of land as far as
the hill which rises there, and besides they wished to preserve their
land unplundered; accordingly they agreed to give two thousand pounds
of silver. Then indeed Megas entreated Chosroes in behalf of all the
inhabitants of the East, and would not cease his entreaty, until
Chosroes promised him that he would accept ten centenaria of gold and
depart from the whole Roman empire.</p>
<br />
<p>VII</p>

<p>Thus, then, on that day Megas departed thence and went on the way to
Antioch, while Chosroes after receiving the ransom was moving toward
Beroea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vii_1" id="PageII_vii_1">[1-11]</a></span> This city lies between Antioch and Hierapolis, at a
distance from both of two-days' journey for an unencumbered traveller.
Now while Megas, who travelled with a small company, advanced very
quickly, the Persian army was accomplishing only one half of the
distance which he travelled each day. And so on the fourth day he
reached Antioch, while the Persians came to the suburb of Beroea. And
Chosroes immediately sent Paulus and demanded money of the Beroeans,
not only as much as he had received from the Hierapolitans, but double
the amount, since he saw that their wall in many places was very
vulnerable. As for the Beroeans, since they could by no means place
confidence in their fortifications, they gladly agreed to give all,
but after giving two thousand pounds of silver, they said that they
were not able to give the remainder. And since Chosroes pressed them
on this account, on the following night all of them fled for refuge
into the fortress which is on the acropolis together with the soldiers
who had been stationed there to guard the place. And on the following
day men were sent to the city by Chosroes in order to receive the
money; but on coming near the fortifications they found all the gates
closed, and being unable to discover any man, they reported the
situation to the king. And he commanded them to set ladders against
the wall and to make trial of mounting it, and they did as directed.
Then since no one opposed them, they got inside the fortifications and
opened the gates at their leisure, and received into the city the
whole army and Chosroes himself. By this time the king was furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vii_11" id="PageII_vii_11">[11-18]</a></span>
with anger and he fired nearly the whole city. He then mounted the
acropolis and decided to storm the fortress. There indeed the Roman
soldiers while valiantly defending themselves slew some of the enemy;
but Chosroes was greatly favoured by fortune by reason of the folly of
the besieged, who had not sought refuge in this fortress by
themselves, but along with all their horses and other animals, and by
this inconsiderate act they were placed at a great disadvantage and
began to be in danger. For since there was only one spring there and
the horses and mules and other animals drank from it when they should
not have done so, it came about that the water was exhausted. Such,
then, was the situation of the Beroeans.</p>

<p>Megas, upon reaching Antioch and announcing the terms arranged by him
with Chosroes, failed utterly to persuade them to carry out this
agreement. For it happened that the Emperor Justinian had sent John,
the son of Rufinus, and Julian, his private<a name="FNanchor_4_36" id="FNanchor_4_36" /><a href="#Footnote_4_36" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> secretary, as
ambassadors to Chosroes. The person holding this office is styled &quot;a
secretis&quot; by the Romans; for secrets they are accustomed to call
&quot;secreta.&quot; These men had reached Antioch and were remaining there. Now
Julian, one of the ambassadors, explicitly forbade everybody to give
money to the enemy, or to purchase the cities of the emperor, and
besides he denounced to Germanus the chief priest Ephraemius, as being
eager to deliver over the city to Chosroes. For this reason Megas
returned unsuccessful. But Ephraemius, the bishop of Antioch, fearing
the attack of the Persians, went into Cilicia. There too came Germanus
not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vii_18" id="PageII_vii_18">[18-23]</a></span> afterwards, taking with him some few men but leaving
the most of them in Antioch.</p>

<p>Megas then came in haste to Beroea, and in vexation at what had taken
place, he charged Chosroes with having treated the Beroeans
outrageously; for while, as it seemed, he had sent him to Antioch to
arrange the treaty, he had both plundered the property of the
citizens, though they had committed no wrong at all, and had compelled
them to shut themselves up in that fortress, and had then set fire to
the city and razed it to the ground in defiance of right. To this
Chosroes replied as follows: &quot;Verily, my friend, you yourself are
responsible for these things, in having compelled us to delay here;
for as it is, you have arrived, not at the appointed time, but far
behind it. And as for the strange conduct of your fellow-citizens, my
most excellent sir, why should one make speeches of great length? For
after agreeing to give us a fixed amount of silver for their own
safety, they even now do not think it necessary to fulfil the
agreement, but placing such complete confidence in the strength of
their position, they are disregarding us absolutely, while we are
compelled to undertake the siege of a fortress, as you surely see. But
for my part, I have hope that with the help of the gods I shall have
vengeance upon them shortly, and execute upon the guilty the
punishment for the Persians whom I have lost wrongfully before this
wall.&quot; So spoke Chosroes, and Megas replied as follows: &quot;If one should
consider that as king thou art making these charges against men who
are in pitiable and most dishonoured plight, he would be compelled
without a word of protest to agree with what thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vii_23" id="PageII_vii_23">[23-31]</a></span> hast said; for
authority which is unlimited is bound by its very nature to carry with
it also supremacy in argument; but if one be permitted to shake off
all else and to espouse the truth of the matter, thou wouldst have, O
King, nothing with which justly to reproach us; but mayst thou hear
all mildly. First, as for me, since the time when I was sent to
declare to the men of Antioch the message which thou didst send them,
seven days have passed (and what could be done more quickly than
this?) and now coming into thy presence I find these things
accomplished by thee against my fatherland; but these men, having
already lost all that is most valuable, thereafter have only one
struggle to engage in&mdash;that for life&mdash;and have come, I think, so to be
masters of the situation that they can no longer be compelled to pay
thee any of the money. For to pay a thing which one does not possess
could not be made possible for a man by any device. From of old indeed
have the names of things been well and suitably distinguished by men;
and among these distinctions is this, that want of power is separated
from want of consideration. For when the latter by reason of
intemperance of mind proceeds to resistance, it is accustomed to be
detested, as is natural, but when the former, because of the
impossibility of performing a service, is driven to the same point, it
deserves to be pitied. Permit, therefore, O King, that, while we
receive as our portion all the direst misfortunes, we may take with us
this consolation at least, that we should not seem to have been
ourselves responsible for the things which have befallen us. And as
for money, consider that what thou hast taken into thy possession is
sufficient for thee, not weighing this by thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_vii_31" id="PageII_vii_31">[31-37]</a></span> position, but with
regard to the power of the Beroeans. But beyond this do not force us
in any way, lest perchance thou shouldst seem unable to accomplish the
thing to which thou hast set thy hand; for excess is always punished
by meeting obstacles that cannot be overcome, and the best course is
not to essay the impossible. Let this, then, be my defence for the
moment in behalf of these men. But if I should be able to have
converse with the sufferers, I should have something else also to say
which has now escaped me.&quot; So spoke Megas, and Chosroes permitted him
to go into the acropolis. And when he had gone there and learned all
that had happened concerning the spring, weeping he came again before
Chosroes, and lying prone on the ground insisted that no money at all
was left to the Beroeans, and entreated him to grant him only the
lives of the men. Moved by the tearful entreaties of the man Chosroes
fulfilled his request, and binding himself by an oath, gave pledges to
all on the acropolis. Then the Beroeans, after coming into such great
danger, left the acropolis free from harm, and departing went each
his own way. Among the soldiers some few followed them, but the
majority came as willing deserters to Chosroes, putting forth as their
grievance that the government owed them their pay for a long time; and
with him they later went into the land of Persia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_1" id="PageII_viii_1">[1-7]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>VIII</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">June 540 A.D.</span>
Then Chosroes (since Megas said that he had by no means persuaded the
inhabitants of Antioch to bring him the money) went with his whole
army against them. Some of the population of Antioch thereupon
departed from there with their money and fled as each one could. And
all the rest likewise were purposing to do the same thing, and would
have done so had not the commanders of the troops in Lebanon,
Theoctistus and Molatzes, who arrived in the meantime with six
thousand men, fortified them with hope and thus prevented their
departure. Not long after this the Persian army also came. There they
all pitched their tents and made camp fronting on the River Orontes
and not very far from the stream. Chosroes then sent Paulus up beside
the fortifications and demanded money from the men of Antioch, saying
that for ten centenaria<a name="FNanchor_5_37" id="FNanchor_5_37" /><a href="#Footnote_5_37" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of gold he would depart from there, and it
was obvious that he would accept even less than this for his
withdrawal. And on that day their ambassadors went before Chosroes,
and after speaking at length concerning the breaking of the peace and
hearing much from him, they retired. But on the morrow the populace of
Antioch (for they are not seriously disposed, but are always engaged
in jesting and disorderly performance) heaped insults upon Chosroes
from the battlements and taunted him with unseemly laughter; and when
Paulus came near the fortifications and exhorted them to purchase
freedom for themselves and the city for a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_7" id="PageII_viii_7">[7-13]</a></span> sum of money, they
very nearly killed him with shots from their bows, and would have done
so if he had not seen their purpose in time and guarded against it. On
account of this Chosroes, boiling with anger, decided to storm the
wall.</p>

<p>On the following day, accordingly, he led up all the Persians against
the wall and commanded a portion of the army to make assaults at
different points along the river, and he himself with the most of the
men and best troops directed an attack against the height. For at this
place, as has been stated by me above, the wall of fortification was
most vulnerable. Thereupon the Romans, since the structure on which
they were to stand when fighting was very narrow, devised the
following remedy. Binding together long timbers they suspended them
between the towers, and in this way they made these spaces much
broader, in order that still more men might be able to ward off the
assailants from there. So the Persians, pressing on most vigorously
from all sides, were sending their arrows thickly everywhere, and
especially along the crest of the hill. Meanwhile the Romans were
fighting them back with all their strength, not soldiers alone, but
also many of the most courageous youths of the populace. But it
appeared that those who were attacking the wall there were engaged in
a battle on even terms with their enemy. For the rock which was broad
and high and, as it were, drawn up against the fortifications caused
the conflict to be just as if on level ground. And if anyone of the
Roman army had had the courage to get outside the fortifications with
three hundred men and to anticipate the enemy in seizing this rock and
to ward off the assailants<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_13" id="PageII_viii_13">[13-17]</a></span> from there, never, I believe, would the
city have come into any danger from the enemy. For the barbarians had
no point from which they could have conducted their assault, for they
would be exposed to missiles from above both from the rock and from
the wall; but as it was (for it was fated that Antioch be destroyed by
this army of the Medes), this idea occurred to no one. So then while
the Persians were fighting beyond their power, since Chosroes was
present with them and urging them on with a mighty cry, giving their
opponents not a moment in which to look about or guard against the
missiles discharged from their bows, and while the Romans, in great
numbers and with much shouting, were defending themselves still more
vigorously, the ropes with which the beams had been bound together,
failing to support the weight, suddenly broke asunder and the timbers
together with all those who had taken their stand on them fell to the
ground with a mighty crash. When this was heard by other Romans also,
who were fighting from the adjoining towers, being utterly unable to
comprehend what had happened, but supposing that the wall at this
point had been destroyed, they beat a hasty retreat. Now many young
men of the populace who in former times had been accustomed to engage
in factional strife with each other in the hippodromes descended into
the city from the fortification wall, but they refused to flee and
remained where they were, while the soldiers with Theoctistus and
Molatzes straightway leaped upon the horses which happened to be ready
there and rode away to the gates, telling the others a tale to the
effect that Bouzes had come with an army and they wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_17" id="PageII_viii_17">[17-23]</a></span> receive
them quickly into the city, and with them to ward off the enemy.
Thereupon many of the men of Antioch and all the women with their
children made a great rush toward the gates; but since they were
crowded by the horses, being in very narrow quarters, they began to
fall down. The soldiers, however, sparing absolutely no one of those
before them, all kept riding over the fallen still more fiercely than
before, and a great many were killed there, especially about the
gates themselves.</p>

<p>But the Persians, with no one opposing them, set ladders against the
wall and mounted with no difficulty. And quickly reaching the
battlements, for a time they were by no means willing to descend, but
they seemed like men looking about them and at a loss what to do,
because, as it seems to me, they supposed that the rough ground was
beset with some ambuscades of the enemy. For the land inside the
fortifications which one traverses immediately upon descending from
the height is an uninhabited tract extending for a great distance and
there are found there rocks which rise to a very great height, and
steep places. But some say that it was by the will of Chosroes that
the Persians hesitated. For when he observed the difficulty of the
ground and saw the soldiers fleeing, he feared lest by reason of some
necessity they should turn back from their retreat and make trouble
for the Persians, and thus become an obstacle, as might well happen,
in the way of his capturing a city which was both ancient and of great
importance and the first of all the cities which the Romans had
throughout the East both in wealth and in size and in population and
in beauty and in prosperity of every kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_23" id="PageII_viii_23">[23-31]</a></span> Hence it was that,
considering everything else of less account, he wished to allow the
Roman soldiers freely to avail themselves of the chance for flight.
For this reason too the Persians also made signs to the fugitives with
their hands, urging them to flee as quickly as possible. So the
soldiers of the Romans together with their commanders took a hasty
departure, all of them, through the gate which leads to Daphne, the
suburb of Antioch; for from this gate alone the Persians kept away
while the others were seized; and of the populace some few escaped
with the soldiers. Then when the Persians saw that all the Roman
soldiers had gone on, they descended from the height and got into the
middle of the city. There, however, many of the young men of Antioch
engaged in battle with them, and at first they seemed to have the
upper hand in the conflict. Some of them were in heavy armour, but the
majority were unarmed and using only stones as missiles. And pushing
back the enemy they raised the paean, and with shouts proclaimed the
Emperor Justinian triumphant, as if they had won the victory.</p>

<p>At this point Chosroes, seated on the tower which is on the height,
summoned the ambassadors, wishing to say something. And one of his
officers, Zaberganes, thinking that he wished to have words with the
ambassadors concerning a settlement, came quickly before the king and
spoke as follows: &quot;Thou dost not seem to me, O Master, to think in the
same way as do the Romans concerning the safety of these men. For they
both before fighting offer insults to thy kingdom, and when they are
defeated dare the impossible and do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_viii_31" id="PageII_viii_31">[31-1]</a></span> Persians irreparable harm,
as if fearing lest some reason for shewing them humanity should be
left in thee; but thou art wishing to pity those who do not ask to be
saved, and hast shewn zeal to spare those who by no means wish it.
Meanwhile these men have set an ambush in a captured city and are
destroying the victors by means of snares, although all the soldiers
have long since fled from them.&quot; When Chosroes heard this, he sent a
large number of the best troops against them, and these not long
afterwards returned and announced that nothing untoward had come to
pass. For already the Persians had forced back the citizens by their
numbers and turned them to flight, and a great slaughter took place
there. For the Persians did not spare persons of any age and were
slaying all whom they met, old and young alike. At that time they say
that two women of those who were illustrious in Antioch got outside
the fortifications, but perceiving that they would fall into the hands
of the enemy (for they were already plainly seen going about
everywhere), went running to the River Orontes, and, fearing lest the
Persians should do them some insult, they covered their faces with
their veils and threw themselves into the river's current and were
carried out of sight. Thus the inhabitants of Antioch were visited
with every form of misfortune.</p>
<br />
<p>IX</p>

<p>Then Chosroes spoke to the ambassadors as follows: &quot;Not far from the
truth, I think, is the ancient saying that God does not give
blessings<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ix_1" id="PageII_ix_1">[1-8]</a></span> unmixed, but He mingles them with troubles and then
bestows them upon men. And for this reason we do not even have
laughter without tears, but there is always attached to our successes
some misfortune, and to our pleasures pain, not permitting anyone to
enjoy in its purity such good fortune as is granted. For this city,
which is of altogether preeminent importance in fact as well as in
name in the land of the Romans I have indeed succeeded in capturing
with the least exertion, since God has provided the victory all at
once for us, as you doubtless see. But when I behold the massacre of
such a multitude of men, and the victory thus drenched with blood,
there arises in me no sense of the delight that should follow my
achievement. And for this the wretched men of Antioch are to blame,
for when the Persians were storming the wall they did not prove able
to keep them back, and then when they had already triumphed and had
captured the city at the first cry these men with unreasoned daring
sought to die fighting against them in close combat. So while all the
notables of the Persians were harassing me unceasingly with their
demand that I should drag the city as with a net and destroy all the
captives, I was commanding the fugitives to press on still more in
their flight, in order that they might save themselves as quickly as
possible. For to trample upon captives is not holy.&quot; Such
high-sounding and airy words did Chosroes speak to the ambassadors,
but nevertheless it did not escape them why he gave time to the Romans
in their flight.</p>
<p>For he was the cleverest of all men at saying that
which was not, and in concealing the truth, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ix_8" id="PageII_ix_8">[8-12]</a></span> attributing the
blame for the wrongs which he committed to those who suffered the
wrong; besides he was ready to agree to everything and to pledge the
agreement with an oath, and much more ready to forget completely the
things lately agreed to and sworn to by him, and for the sake of money
to debase his soul without reluctance to every act of pollution&mdash;a
past master at feigning piety in his countenance, and absolving
himself in words from the responsibility of the act. This man well
displayed his own peculiar character on a certain occasion at Sura;
for after he had hoodwinked the inhabitants of the city by a trick and
had destroyed them in the manner which I have described, although they
had previously done him no wrong at all, he saw, while the city was
being captured, a comely woman and one not of lowly station being
dragged by her left hand with great violence by one of the barbarians;
and the child, which she had only lately weaned, she was unwilling to
let go, but was dragging it with her other hand, fallen, as it was, to
the ground since it was not able to keep pace with that violent
running. And they say that he uttered a pretended groan, and making it
appear to all who were present at that time including Anastasius the
ambassador that he was all in tears, he prayed God to exact vengeance
from the man who was guilty of the troubles which had come to pass.
Now Justinian, the Emperor of the Romans, was the one whom he wished
to have understood, though he knew well that he himself was most
responsible for everything. Endowed with such a singular nature
Chosroes both<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ix_12" id="PageII_ix_12">[12-17]</a></span> became King of the Persians (for ill fortune had
deprived Zames of his eye, he who in point of years had first right to
the kingdom, at any rate after Caoses, whom Cabades for no good reason
hated), and with no difficulty he conquered those who revolted
against him, and all the harm which he purposed to do the Romans he
accomplished easily. For every time when Fortune wishes to make a man
great, she does at the fitting times those things which she has
decided upon, with no one standing against the force of her will; and
she neither regards the man's station, nor purposes to prevent the
occurrence of things which ought not to be, nor does she give heed
that many will blaspheme against her because of these things, mocking
scornfully at that which has been done by her contrary to the deserts
of the man who receives her favour; nor does she take into
consideration anything else at all, if only she accomplish the thing
which has been decided upon by her. But as for these matters, let them
be as God wishes.</p>

<p>Chosroes commanded the army to capture and enslave the survivors of
the population of Antioch, and to plunder all the property, while he
himself with the ambassadors descended from the height to the
sanctuary which they call a church. There Chosroes found stores of
gold and silver so great in amount that, though he took no other part
of the booty except these stores, he departed possessed of enormous
wealth. And he took down from there many wonderful marbles and ordered
them to be deposited outside the fortifications, in order that they
might convey these too to the land of Persia. When he had finished
these things, he gave orders to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_ix_17" id="PageII_ix_17">[17-4]</a></span> Persians to burn the whole
city. And the ambassadors begged him to withhold his hand only from
the church, for which he had carried away ransom in abundance. This he
granted to the ambassadors, but gave orders to burn everything else;
then, leaving there a few men who were to fire the city, he himself
with all the rest retired to the camp where they had previously set up
their tents.</p>
<br />
<p>X</p>

<p>A short time before this calamity God displayed a sign to the
inhabitants of that city, by which He indicated the things which were
to be. For the standards of the soldiers who had been stationed there
for a long time had been standing previously toward the west, but of
their own accord they turned and stood toward the east, and then
returned again to their former position untouched by anyone. This the
soldiers shewed to many who were near at hand and among them the
manager of finances in the camp, while the standards were still
trembling. This man, Tatianus by name, was an especially discreet
person, a native of Mopsuestia. But even so those who saw this sign
did not recognize that the mastery of the place would pass from the
western to the eastern king, in order, evidently, that escape might be
utterly impossible for those who were bound to suffer those things
which came to pass.</p>

<p>But I become dizzy as I write of such a great calamity and transmit it
to future times, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_x_4" id="PageII_x_4">[4-10]</a></span> unable to understand why indeed it should
be the will of God to exalt on high the fortunes of a man or of a
place, and then to cast them down and destroy them for no cause which
appears to us. For it is wrong to say that with Him all things are not
always done with reason, though he then endured to see Antioch brought
down to the ground at the hands of a most unholy man, a city whose
beauty and grandeur in every respect could not even so be utterly
concealed.</p>

<p>So, then, after the city had been destroyed, the church was left
solitary, thanks to the activity and foresight of the Persians to whom
this work was assigned. And there were also left about the so-called
Cerataeum many houses, not because of the foresight of any man, but,
since they were situated at the extremity of the city, and not
connected with any other building, the fire failed entirely to reach
them. The barbarians burned also the parts outside the fortifications,
except the sanctuary which is dedicated to St. Julianus and the
houses which stand about this sanctuary. For it happened that the
ambassadors had taken up their lodgings there. As for the
fortifications, the Persians left them wholly untouched.</p>

<p>A little later the ambassadors again came to Chosroes and spoke as
follows: &quot;If our words were not addressed to thee in thy presence, O
King, we should never believe that Chosroes, the son of Cabades, had
come into the land of the Romans in arms, dishonouring the oaths
which have recently been sworn by thee&mdash;for such pledges are regarded
as the last and most firm security of all things among<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_x_10" id="PageII_x_10">[10-16]</a></span> men to
guarantee mutual trust and truthfulness&mdash;and breaking the treaty,
though hope in treaties is the only thing left to those who are living
in insecurity because of the evil deeds of war. For one might say of
such a state of affairs that it is nothing else than the
transformation of the habits of men into those of beasts. For in a
time when no treaties at all are made, there will remain certainly war
without end, and war which has no end is always calculated to estrange
from their proper nature those who engage in it. With what intent,
moreover, didst thou write to thy brother not long ago that he himself
was responsible for the breaking of the treaty? Was it not obviously
with the admission that the breaking of treaties is an exceedingly
great evil? If therefore he has done no wrong, thou art not acting
justly now in coming against us; but if it happen that thy brother has
done any such thing, yet let thy complaint have its fulfilment thus
far, and go no farther, that thou mayst shew thyself superior. For he
who submits to be worsted in evil things would in better things justly
be victorious. And yet we know well that the Emperor Justinian has
never gone contrary to the treaty, and we entreat thee not to do the
Romans such harm, from which there will be no advantage to the
Persians, and thou wilt gain only this, that thou wilt have wrongfully
wrought deeds of irreparable harm upon those who have recently made
peace with thee.&quot; So spoke the ambassadors.</p>

<p>And Chosroes, upon hearing this, insisted that the treaty had been
broken by the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_x_16" id="PageII_x_16">[16-23]</a></span> Justinian; and he enumerated the causes of
war which the Emperor afforded, some of them of real importance and
others idle and fabricated without any reason; most of all he wished
to shew that the letters written by him to Alamoundaras and the Huns
were the chief cause of the war, just as I have stated above.<a name="FNanchor_6_38" id="FNanchor_6_38" /><a href="#Footnote_6_38" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But
as for any Roman who had invaded the land of Persia, or who had made a
display of warlike deeds, he was unable either to mention or to point
out such a one. The ambassadors, however, referred the charges in part
not to Justinian but to certain of those who had served him, while in
the case of others they took exception to what he had said on the
ground that the things had not taken place as stated. Finally Chosroes
made the demand that the Romans give him a large sum of money, but he
warned them not to hope to establish peace for all time by giving
money at that moment only. For friendship, he said, which is made by
men on terms of money is generally spent as fast as the money is used
up. It was necessary, therefore, that the Romans should pay some
definite annual sum to the Persians. &quot;For thus,&quot; he said, &quot;the
Persians will keep the peace secure for them, guarding the Caspian
Gates themselves and no longer feeling resentment at them on account
of the city of Daras, in return for which the Persians themselves will
be in their pay forever.&quot; &quot;So,&quot; said the ambassadors, &quot;the Persians
desire to have the Romans subject and tributary to themselves.&quot; &quot;No,&quot;
said Chosroes, &quot;but the Romans will have the Persians as their own
soldiers for the future, dispensing to them a fixed payment for their
service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_x_23" id="PageII_x_23">[23-3]</a></span> for you give an annual payment of gold to some of the
Huns and to the Saracens, not as tributary subjects to them, but in
order that they may guard your land unplundered for all time.&quot; After
Chosroes and the ambassadors had spoken thus at length with each
other, they at last came to terms, agreeing that Chosroes should
forthwith take from the Romans fifty centenaria,<a name="FNanchor_7_39" id="FNanchor_7_39" /><a href="#Footnote_7_39" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and that,
receiving a tribute of five more centenaria annually for all time, he
should do them no further harm, but taking with him hostages from the
ambassadors to pledge the keeping of the agreement, should make his
departure with the whole army to his native land, and that there
ambassadors sent from the Emperor Justinian should arrange on a firm
basis for the future the compact regarding the peace.</p>
<br />
<p>XI</p>

<p>Then Chosroes went to Seleucia, a city on the sea, one hundred and
thirty stades distant from Antioch; and there he neither met nor
harmed a single Roman, and he bathed himself alone in the sea-water,
and after sacrificing to the sun and such other divinities as he
wished, and calling upon the gods many times, he went back. And when
he came to the camp, he said that he had a desire to see the city of
Apamea which was in the vicinity for no other reason than that of his
interest in the place. And the ambassadors unwillingly granted this
also, but only on condition that after seeing the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xi_3" id="PageII_xi_3">[3-11]</a></span> and taking
away with him from there one thousand pounds of silver, he should,
without inflicting any further injury, march back. But it was evident
to the ambassadors and to all the others that Chosroes was setting out
for Apamea with this sole purpose, that he might lay hold upon some
pretext of no importance and plunder both the city and the land
thereabout. Accordingly he first went up to Daphne, the suburb of
Antioch, where he expressed great wonder at the grove and at the
fountains of water; for both of these are very well worth seeing. And
after sacrificing to the nymphs he departed, doing no further damage
than burning the sanctuary of the archangel Michael together with
certain other buildings, for the following reason. A Persian gentleman
of high repute in the army of the Persians and well known to Chosroes,
the king, while riding on horseback came in company with some others
to a precipitous place near the so-called Tretum, where is a temple of
the archangel Michael, the work of Evaris. This man, seeing one of the
young men of Antioch on foot and alone concealing himself there,
separated from the others and pursued him. Now the young man was a
butcher, Aeimachus by name. When he was about to be overtaken, he
turned about unexpectedly and threw a stone at his pursuer which hit
him on the forehead and penetrated to the membrane by the ear. And the
rider fell immediately to the ground, whereupon the youth drew out his
sword and slew him. Then at his leisure he stripped him of his weapons
and all his gold and whatever else he had on his person, and leaping
upon his horse rode on. And whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xi_11" id="PageII_xi_11">[11-17]</a></span> by the favour of fortune or by
his knowledge of the country, he succeeded completely in eluding the
Persians and making good his escape. When Chosroes learned this, he
was deeply grieved at what had happened, and commanded some of his
followers to burn the sanctuary of the archangel Michael which I have
mentioned above. And they, thinking that the sanctuary at Daphne was
the one in question, burned it with the buildings about it, and they
supposed that the commands of Chosroes had been executed. Such, then,
was the course of these events.</p>

<p>But Chosroes with his whole army proceeded on the way to Apamea. Now
there is a piece of wood one cubit in length in Apamea, a portion of
the cross on which the Christ in Jerusalem once endured the punishment
not unwillingly, as is generally agreed, and which in ancient times
had been conveyed there secretly by a man of Syria. And the men of
olden times, believing that it would be a great protection both for
themselves and for the city, made for it a sort of wooden chest and
deposited it there; and they adorned this chest with much gold and
with precious stones and they entrusted it to three priests who were
to guard it in all security; and they bring it forth every year and
the whole population worship it during one day. Now at that time the
people of Apamea, upon learning that the army of the Medes was coming
against them, began to be in great fear. And when they heard that
Chosroes was absolutely untruthful, they came to Thomas, the chief
priest of the city, and begged him to shew them the wood of the cross,
in order that after worshipping it for the last time they might die.
And he did as they requested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xi_17" id="PageII_xi_17">[17-24]</a></span> Then indeed it befell that a sight
surpassing both description and belief was there seen. For while the
priest was carrying the wood and shewing it, above him followed a
flame of fire, and the portion of the roof over him was illuminated
with a great and unaccustomed light. And while the priest was moving
through every part of the temple, the flame continued to advance with
him, keeping constantly the place above him in the roof. So the people
of Apamea, under the spell of joy at the miracle, were wondering and
rejoicing and weeping, and already all felt confidence concerning
their safety. And Thomas, after going about the whole temple, laid the
wood of the cross in the chest and covered it, and suddenly the light
had ceased. Then upon learning that the army of the enemy had come
close to the city, he went in great haste to Chosroes. And when the
king enquired of the priest whether it was the will of the citizens of
Apamea to marshal themselves on the wall against the army of the
Medes, the priest replied that no such thing had entered the minds of
the men. &quot;Therefore,&quot; said Chosroes, &quot;receive me into the city
accompanied by a few men with all the gates opened wide.&quot; And the
priest said &quot;Yes, for I have come here to invite thee to do this very
thing.&quot; So the whole army pitched their tents and made camp before the
fortifications.</p>

<p>Then Chosroes chose out two hundred of the best of the Persians and
entered the city. But when he had got inside the gates, he forgot
willingly enough what had been agreed upon between himself and the
ambassadors, and he commanded the bishop to give not only one thousand
pounds of silver nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xi_24" id="PageII_xi_24">[24-31]</a></span> even ten times that amount, but whatsoever
treasures were stored there, being all of gold and silver and of
marvellous great size. And I believe that he would not have shrunk
from enslaving and plundering the whole city, unless some divine
providence had manifestly prevented him; to such a degree did avarice
overpower him and the desire of fame turn his mind. For he thought the
enslavement of the cities a great glory for himself, considering it
absolutely nothing that disregarding treaties and compacts he was
performing such deeds against the Romans. This attitude of Chosroes
will be revealed by what he undertook to do concerning the city of
Daras during his withdrawal at this same time, when he treated his
agreements with absolute disregard, and also by what he did to the
citizens of Callinicus a little later in time of peace, as will be
told by me in the following narrative.<a name="FNanchor_8_40" id="FNanchor_8_40" /><a href="#Footnote_8_40" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But God, as has been said,
preserved Apamea. Now when Chosroes had seized all the treasures, and
Thomas saw that he was already intoxicated with the abundance of the
wealth, then bringing out the wood of the cross with the chest, he
opened the chest and displaying the wood said: &quot;O most mighty King,
these alone are left me out of all the treasures. Now as for this
chest (since it is adorned with gold and precious stones), we do not
begrudge thy taking it and keeping it with all the rest, but this wood
here, it is our salvation and precious to us, this, I beg and entreat
thee, give to me.&quot; So spoke the priest. And Chosroes yielded and
fulfilled the request.</p>

<p>Afterwards, being filled with a desire for popular applause, he
commanded that the populace should<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xi_31" id="PageII_xi_31">[31-38]</a></span> go up into the hippodrome and
that the charioteers should hold their accustomed contests. And he
himself went up there also, eager to be a spectator of the
performances. And since he had heard long before that the Emperor
Justinian was extraordinarily fond of the Venetus<a name="FNanchor_9_41" id="FNanchor_9_41" /><a href="#Footnote_9_41" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> colour, which is
blue, wishing to go against him there also, he was desirous of
bringing about victory for the green. So the charioteers, starting
from the barriers, began the contest, and by some chance he who was
clad in the blue happened to pass his rival and take the lead. And he
was followed in the same tracks by the wearer of the green colour. And
Chosroes, thinking that this had been done purposely, was angry, and
he cried out with a threat that the Caesar had wrongfully surpassed
the others, and he commanded that the horses which were running in
front should be held up, in order that from then on they might contend
in the rear; and when this had been done just as he commanded, then
Chosroes and the green faction were accounted victorious. At that time
one of the citizens of Apamea came before Chosroes and accused a
Persian of entering his house and violating his maiden daughter. Upon
hearing this, Chosroes, boiling with anger, commanded that the man
should be brought. And when he came before him, he directed that he
should be impaled in the camp. And when the people learned this, they
raised a mighty shout as loud as they could, demanding that the man be
saved from the king's anger. And Chosroes promised that he would
release the man to them, but he secretly impaled him not long
afterwards. So after these things had been thus accomplished, he
departed and marched back with the whole army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_1" id="PageII_xii_1">[1-5]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>XII</p>

<p>And when he came to the city of Chalcis, eighty-four stades distant
from the city of Beroea, he again seemed to forget the things which
had been agreed upon, and encamping not far from the fortifications he
sent Paulus to threaten the inhabitants of Chalcis, saying that he
would take the city by siege, unless they should purchase their safety
by giving ransom, and should give up to the Persians all the soldiers
who were there together with their leader. And the citizens of Chalcis
were seized with great fear of both sovereigns, and they swore that,
as for soldiers, there were absolutely none of them in the city,
although they had hidden Adonachus, the commander of the soldiers, and
others as well in some houses, in order that they might not be seen
by the enemy; and with difficulty they collected two centenaria<a name="FNanchor_10_42" id="FNanchor_10_42" /><a href="#Footnote_10_42" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of
gold, for the city they inhabited was not very prosperous, and they
gave them to Chosroes as the price of their lives and thus saved both
the city and themselves.</p>

<p>From there on Chosroes did not wish to continue the return journey by
the road he had come, but to cross the River Euphrates and gather by
plunder as much money as possible from Mesopotamia. He therefore
constructed a bridge at the place called Obbane, which is forty stades
distant from the fortress in Barbalissum; then he himself went across
and gave orders to the whole army to cross as quickly as possible,
adding that he would break up the bridge on the third day, and he
appointed also the time of the day. And when the appointed day was
come, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_5" id="PageII_xii_5">[5-11]</a></span> happened that some of the army were left who had not yet
crossed, but without the least consideration for them he sent the men
to break up the bridge. And those who were left behind returned to
their native land as each one could.</p>

<p>Then a sort of ambition came over Chosroes to capture the city of
Edessa. For he was led on to this by a saying of the Christians, and
it kept irritating his mind, because they maintained that it could not
be taken, for the following reason. There was a certain Augarus in
early times, toparch of Edessa (for thus the kings of the different
nations were called then). Now this Augarus was the most clever of all
men of his time, and as a result of this was an especial friend of the
Emperor Augustus. For, desiring to make a treaty with the Romans, he
came to Rome; and when he conversed with Augustus, he so astonished
him by the abundance of his wisdom that Augustus wished never more to
give up his company; for he was an ardent lover of his conversation,
and whenever he met him, he was quite unwilling to depart from him. A
long time, therefore, was consumed by him in this visit. And one day
when he was desirous of returning to his native land and was utterly
unable to persuade Augustus to let him go, he devised the following
plan. He first went out to hunt in the country about Rome; for it
happened that he had taken considerable interest in the practice of
this sport. And going about over a large tract of country, he captured
alive many of the animals of that region, and he gathered up and took
with him from each part of the country some earth from the land; thus
he returned to Rome bringing both the earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_11" id="PageII_xii_11">[11-20]</a></span> the animals. Then
Augustus went up into the hippodrome and seated himself as was his
wont, and Augarus came before him and displayed the earth and the
animals, telling over from what district each portion of earth was and
what animals they were. Then he gave orders to put the earth in
different parts of the hippodrome, and to gather all the animals into
one place and then to release them. So the attendants did as he
directed. And the animals, separating from each other, went each to
that portion of earth which was from the district in which it itself
had been taken. And Augustus looked upon the performance carefully for
a very long time, and he was wondering that nature untaught makes
animals miss their native land. Then Augarus, suddenly laying hold
upon his knees, said: &quot;But as for me, O Master, what thoughts dost
thou think I have, who possess a wife and children and a kingdom,
small indeed, but in the land of my fathers?&quot; And the emperor,
overcome and compelled by the truth of his saying, granted not at all
willingly that he should go away, and bade him ask besides whatever he
wished. And when Augarus had secured this, he begged of Augustus to
build him a hippodrome in the city of Edessa. And he granted also
this. Thus then Augarus departed from Rome and came to Edessa. And the
citizens enquired of him whether he had come bringing any good thing
for them from the Emperor Augustus. And he answering said he had
brought to the inhabitants of Edessa pain without loss and pleasure
without gain, hinting at the fortune of the hippodrome.</p>

<p>At a later time when Augarus was well advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_20" id="PageII_xii_20">[20-26]</a></span> in years, he was
seized with an exceedingly violent attack of gout. And being
distressed by the pains and his inability to move in consequence of
them, he carried the matter to the physicians, and from the whole land
he gathered all who were skilled in these matters. But later he
abandoned these men (for they did not succeed in discovering any cure
for the trouble), and finding himself helpless, he bewailed the fate
which was upon him. But about that time Jesus, the Son of God, was in
the body and moving among the men of Palestine, shewing manifestly by
the fact that he never sinned at all, and also by his performing even
things impossible, that he was the Son of God in very truth; for he
called the dead and raised them up as if from sleep, and opened the
eyes of men who had been born blind, and cleansed those whose whole
bodies were covered with leprosy, and released those whose feet were
maimed, and he cured all the other diseases which are called by the
physicians incurable. When these things were reported to Augarus by
those who travelled from Palestine to Edessa, he took courage and
wrote a letter to Jesus, begging him to depart from Judaea and the
senseless people there, and to spend his life with him from that time
forward. When the Christ saw this message, he wrote in reply to
Augarus, saying distinctly that he would not come, but promising him
health in the letter. And they say that he added this also that never
would the city be liable to capture by the barbarians. This final
portion of the letter was entirely unknown to those who wrote the
history of that time; for they did not even make mention of it
anywhere; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_26" id="PageII_xii_26">[26-31]</a></span> men of Edessa say that they found it with the
letter, so that they have even caused the letter to be inscribed in
this form on the gates of the city instead of any other defence. The
city did in fact come under the Medes a short time afterwards, not by
capture however, but in the following manner. A short time after
Augarus received the letter of the Christ, he became free from
suffering, and after living on in health for a long time, he came to
his end. But that one of his sons who succeeded to the kingdom shewed
himself the most unholy of all men, and besides committing many other
wrongs against his subjects, he voluntarily went over to the Persians,
fearing the vengeance which was to come from the Romans. But long
after this the citizens of Edessa destroyed the barbarian guards who
were dwelling with them, and gave the city into the hands of the
Romans. * * *<a name="FNanchor_11_43" id="FNanchor_11_43" /><a href="#Footnote_11_43" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he is eager to attach it to his cause, judging by
what has happened in my time, which I shall present in the appropriate
place. And the thought once occurred to me that, if the Christ did not
write this thing just as I have told it, still, since men have come to
believe in it, He wishes to guard the city uncaptured for this reason,
that He may never give them any pretext for error. As for these
things, then, let them be as God wills, and so let them be told.</p>

<p>For this reason it seemed to Chosroes at that time a matter of moment
to capture Edessa. And when he came to Batne, a small stronghold of no
importance, one day's journey distant from Edessa, he bivouacked there
for that night, but at early dawn he was on the march to Edessa with
his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xii_31" id="PageII_xii_31">[31-4]</a></span> army. But it fell out that they lost their way and
wandered about, and on the following night bivouacked in the same
place; and they say that this happened to them a second time also.
When with difficulty Chosroes reached the neighbourhood of Edessa,
they say that suppuration set in in his face and his jaw became
swollen. For this reason he was quite unwilling to make an attempt on
the city, but he sent Paulus and demanded money from the citizens. And
they said that they had absolutely no fear concerning the city, but in
order that he might not damage the country they agreed to give two
centenaria of gold. And Chosroes took the money and kept the
agreement.</p>
<br />
<p>XIII</p>

<p>At that time also the Emperor Justinian wrote a letter to Chosroes,
promising to carry out the agreement which had been made by him and
the ambassadors regarding the peace.<a name="FNanchor_12_44" id="FNanchor_12_44" /><a href="#Footnote_12_44" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> When this message was
received by Chosroes, he released the hostages and made preparations
for his departure, and he wished to sell off all the captives from
Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they
displayed an unheard-of zeal. For there was not a person who did not
bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary
according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who
even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots
took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw
it down there, and any farmer who was in want<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiii_4" id="PageII_xiii_4">[4-13]</a></span> of plate or of money,
but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with
great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold
and silver and money in other forms, but not a bit of it was given for
ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand
to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some
great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the
captives. And the citizens of Carrhae met him holding out to him great
sums of money; but he said that it did not belong to him because the
most of them are not Christians but are of the old faith.</p>
<p>
But when, likewise, the citizens of Constantina offered money, he
accepted it, although he asserted that the city belonged to him from
his fathers.
<span class="sidenote">503 A.D.</span>
For at the time when Cabades took Amida, he wished also
to capture Edessa and Constantina. But when he came near to Edessa he
enquired of the Magi whether it would be possible for him to capture
the city, pointing out the place to them with his right hand. But they
said that the city would not be captured by him by any device, judging
by the fact that in stretching out his right hand to it he was not
giving thereby the sign of capture or of any other grievous thing, but
of salvation. And when Cabades heard this, he was convinced and led
his army on to Constantina. And upon arriving there, he issued orders
to the whole army to encamp for a siege. Now the priest of Constantina
was at that time Baradotus, a just man and especially beloved of God,
and his prayers for this reason were always effectual for whatever he
wished; and even seeing his face one would have straightway surmised
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiii_13" id="PageII_xiii_13">[13-20]</a></span> this man was most completely acceptable to God. This
Baradotus came then to Cabades bearing wine and dried figs and honey
and unblemished loaves, and entreated him not to make an attempt on a
city which was not of any importance and which was very much neglected
by the Romans, having neither a garrison of soldiers nor any other
defence, but only the inhabitants, who were pitiable folk. Thus spoke
the priest; and Cabades promised that he would grant him the city
freely, and he presented him with all the food-supplies which had been
prepared by him for the army in anticipation of the siege, an
exceedingly great quantity; and thus he departed from the land of the
Romans. For this reason it was that Chosroes claimed that the city
belonged to him from his fathers.</p>

<p>And when he reached Daras, he began a siege; but within the city the
Romans and Martinus, their general (for it happened that he was
there), made their preparations for resistance. Now the city is
surrounded by two walls, the inner one of which is of great size and a
truly wonderful thing to look upon (for each tower reaches to a height
of a hundred feet, and the rest of the wall to sixty), while the
outer wall is much smaller, but in other respects strong and one to be
reckoned with seriously. And the space between has a breadth of not
less than fifty feet; in that place the citizens of Daras are
accustomed to put their cattle and other animals when an enemy assails
them. At first then Chosroes made an assault on the fortifications
toward the west, and forcing back his opponents by overwhelming
numbers of missiles, he set fire to the gates of the small wall.
However<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiii_20" id="PageII_xiii_20">[20-26]</a></span> no one of the barbarians dared to get inside. Next he
decided to make a tunnel secretly at the eastern side of the city. For
at this point alone can the earth be dug, since the other parts of the
fortifications were set upon rock by the builders. So the Persians
began to dig, beginning from their trench. And since this was very
deep, they were neither observed by the enemy nor did they afford
them any means of discovering what was being done. So they had already
gone under the foundations of the outer wall, and were about to reach
the space between the two walls and soon after to pass also the great
wall and take the city by force; but since it was not fated to be
captured by the Persians, someone from the camp of Chosroes came alone
about midday close to the fortifications, whether a man or something
else greater than man, and he made it appear to those who saw him that
he was collecting the weapons which the Romans had a little before
discharged from the wall against the barbarians who were assailing
them. And while doing this and holding his shield before him, he
seemed to be bantering those who were on the parapet and taunting them
with laughter. Then he told them of everything and commanded them all
to be on the watch and to take all possible care for their safety.
After revealing these things he was off, while the Romans with much
shouting and confusion were ordering men to dig the ground between the
two walls. The Persians, on the other hand, not knowing what was being
done, were pushing on the work no less than before. So while the
Persians were making a straight way underground to the wall of the
city, the Romans by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiii_26" id="PageII_xiii_26">[26-2]</a></span> advice of Theodoras, a man learned in the
science called mechanics, were constructing their trench in a
cross-wise direction and making it of sufficient depth, so that when
the Persians had reached the middle point between the two
circuit-walls they suddenly broke into the trench of the Romans. And
the first of them the Romans killed, while those in the rear by
fleeing at top speed into the camp saved themselves. For the Romans
decided by no means to pursue them in the dark. So Chosroes, failing
in this attempt and having no hope that he would take the city by any
device thereafter, opened negotiations with the besieged, and carrying
away a thousand pounds of silver he retired into the land of Persia.
When this came to the knowledge of the Emperor Justinian, he was no
longer willing to carry the agreement into effect, charging Chosroes
with having attempted to capture the city of Daras during a truce.
Such were the fortunes of the Romans during the first invasion of
Chosroes; and the summer drew to its close.</p>
<br />
<p>XIV</p>

<p>Now Chosroes built a city in Assyria in a place one day's journey
distant from the city of Ctesiphon, and he named it the Antioch of
Chosroes and settled there all the captives from Antioch, constructing
for them a bath and a hippodrome and providing that they should have
free enjoyment of their other luxuries besides. For he brought with
him charioteers and musicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiv_2" id="PageII_xiv_2">[2-8]</a></span> both from Antioch and from the other
Roman cities. Besides this he always provisioned these citizens of
Antioch at public expense more carefully than in the fashion of
captives, and he required that they be called king's subjects, so as
to be subordinate to no one of the magistrates, but to the king alone.
And if any one else too who was a Roman in slavery ran away and
succeeded in escaping to the Antioch of Chosroes, and if he was called
a kinsman by any one of those who lived there, it was no longer
possible for the owner of this captive to take him away, not even if
he who had enslaved the man happened to be a person of especial note
among the Persians.</p>

<p>

Thus, then, the portent which had come to the citizens of Antioch in
the reign of Anastasius reached this final fulfilment for them. For at
that time a violent wind suddenly fell upon the suburb of Daphne, and
some of the cypresses which were there of extraordinary height were
overturned from the extremities of their roots and fell to the
earth&mdash;trees which the law forbade absolutely to be cut down.
<span class="sidenote">526 A.D.</span>

Accordingly, a little later, when Justinus was ruling over the Romans,
the place was visited by an exceedingly violent earthquake, which
shook down the whole city and straightway brought to the ground the
most and the finest of the buildings, and it is said that at that time
three hundred thousand of the population of Antioch perished. And
finally in this capture the whole city, as has been said, was
destroyed. Such, then, was the calamity which befell the men of
Antioch.</p>

<p>

And Belisarius came to Byzantium from Italy, summoned by the emperor;
and after he had spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xiv_8" id="PageII_xiv_8">[8-2]</a></span> the winter in Byzantium, the emperor sent
him as general against Chosroes and the Persians at the opening of
spring,
<span class="sidenote">541 A.D.</span>
together with the officers who had come with him from Italy,
one of whom, Valerianus, he commanded to lead the troops in Armenia.
For Martinus had been sent immediately to the East, and for this
reason Chosroes found him at Daras, as has been stated above. And
among the Goths, Vittigis remained in Byzantium, but all the rest
marched with Belisarius against Chosroes. At that time one of the
envoys of Vittigis, he who was assuming the name of bishop, died in
the land of Persia, and the other one remained there. And the man who
followed them as interpreter withdrew to the land of the Romans, and
John, who was commanding the troops in Mesopotamia, arrested him near
the boundaries of Constantina, and bringing him into the city confined
him in a prison; there the man in answer to his enquiries related
everything which had been done. Such, then, was the course of these
events. And Belisarius and his followers went in haste, since he was
eager to anticipate Chosroes' making any second invasion into the land
of the Romans.</p>
<br />
<p>XV</p>

<p>But in the meantime Chosroes was leading his army against Colchis,
where the Lazi were calling him in for the following reason. The Lazi
at first dwelt in the land of Colchis as subjects of the Romans, but
not to the extent of paying them<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_2" id="PageII_xv_2">[2-8]</a></span> tribute or obeying their commands
in any respect, except that, whenever their king died, the Roman
emperor would send emblems of the office to him who was about to
succeed to the throne. And he, together with his subjects, guarded
strictly the boundaries of the land in order that hostile Huns might
not proceed from the Caucasus mountains, which adjoin their territory,
through Lazica and invade the land of the Romans. And they kept guard
without receiving money or troops from the Romans and without ever
joining the Roman armies, but they were always engaged in commerce by
sea with the Romans who live on the Black Sea. For they themselves
have neither salt nor grain nor any other good thing, but by
furnishing skins and hides and slaves they secured the supplies which
they needed. But when the events came to pass in which Gourgenes, the
king of the Iberians, was concerned, as has been told in the preceding
narrative,<a name="FNanchor_13_45" id="FNanchor_13_45" /><a href="#Footnote_13_45" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Roman soldiers began to be quartered among the Lazi;
and these barbarians were annoyed by the soldiers, and most of all by
Peter, the general, a man who was prone to treat insolently those who
came into contact with him. This Peter was a native of Arzanene, which
is beyond the River Nymphius, a district subject to the Persians from
of old, but while still a child he had been captured and enslaved by
the Emperor Justinus at the time when Justinus, after the taking of
Amida, was invading the land of the Persians with Celer's army.<a name="FNanchor_14_46" id="FNanchor_14_46" /><a href="#Footnote_14_46" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
And since his owner showed him great kindness, he attended the school
of a grammatist. And at first he became secretary to Justinus, but
when, after the death of Anastasius, Justinus took over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_8" id="PageII_xv_8">[8-12]</a></span>
Roman empire, Peter was made a general, and he degenerated into a
slave of avarice, if anyone ever did, and shewed himself very fatuous
in his treatment of all.</p>

<p>And later the Emperor Justinian sent different officers to Lazica, and
among them John, whom they called Tzibus, a man of obscure and ignoble
descent, but who had climbed to the office of general by virtue of no
other thing than that he was the most accomplished villain in the
world and most successful in discovering unlawful sources of revenue.
This man unsettled and threw into confusion all the relations of the
Romans and the Lazi. He also persuaded the Emperor Justinian to build
a city on the sea in Lazica, Petra by name; and there he sat as in a
citadel and plundered the property of the Lazi. For the salt, and all
other cargoes which were considered necessary for the Lazi, it was no
longer possible for the merchants to bring into the land of Colchis,
nor could they purchase them elsewhere by sending for them, but he
set up in Petra the so-called &quot;monopoly&quot; and himself became a retail
dealer and overseer of all the handling of these things, buying
everything and selling it to the Colchians, not at the customary
rates, but as dearly as possible. At the same time, even apart from
this, the barbarians were annoyed by the Roman army quartered upon
them, a thing which had not been customary previously. Accordingly,
since they were no longer able to endure these things, they decided to
attach themselves to the Persians and Chosroes, and immediately
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_12" id="PageII_xv_12">[12-18]</a></span> sent to them envoys who were to arrange this without the
knowledge of the Romans. These men had been instructed that they
should take pledges from Chosroes that he would never give up the Lazi
against their will to the Romans, and that with this understanding
they should bring him with the Persian army into the land.</p>

<p>Accordingly the envoys went to the Persians, and coming secretly
before Chosroes they said: &quot;If any people in all time have revolted
from their own friends in any manner whatsoever and attached
themselves wrongfully to men utterly unknown to them, and after that
by the kindness of fortune have been brought back once more with
greatest rejoicing to those who were formerly their own, consider, O
Most mighty King, that such as these are the Lazi. For the Colchians
in ancient times, as allies of the Persians, rendered them many good
services and were themselves treated in like manner; and of these
things there are many records in books, some of which we have, while
others are preserved in thy palace up to the present time. But at a
later time it came about that our ancestors, whether neglected by you
or for some other reason (for we are unable to ascertain anything
certain about this matter), became allies of the Romans. And now we
and the king of Lazica give to the Persians both ourselves and our
land to treat in any way you may desire. And we beg of you to think
thus concerning us: if, on the one hand, we have suffered nothing
outrageous at the hands of the Romans, but have been prompted by
foolish motives in coming to you, reject this prayer of ours
straightway, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_18" id="PageII_xv_18">[18-24]</a></span> that with you likewise the Colchians will
never be trustworthy (for when a friendship has been dissolved, a
second friendship formed with others becomes, owing to its character,
a matter of reproach); but if we have been in name friends of the
Romans, but in fact their loyal slaves, and have suffered impious
treatment at the hands of those who have tyrannized over us, receive
us, your former allies, and acquire as slaves those whom you used to
treat as friends, and shew your hatred of a cruel tyranny which has
risen thus on our borders, by acting worthily of that justice which it
has always been the tradition of the Persians to defend. For the man
who himself does no wrong is not just, unless he is also accustomed to
rescue those who are wronged by others when he has it in his power.
But it is worth while to tell a few of the things which the accursed
Romans have dared to do against us. In the first place they have left
our king only the form of royal power, while they themselves have
appropriated the actual authority, and he sits a king in the position
of a servant, fearing the general who issues the orders; and they have
put upon us a multitude of soldiery, not in order to guard the land
against those who harass us (for not one of our neighbours except,
indeed, the Romans has disturbed us), but in order that they may
confine us as in a prison and make themselves masters of our
possessions. And purposing to make more speedy the robbery of what we
have, behold, O King, what sort of a design they have formed; the
supplies which are in excess among them they compel the Lazi to buy
against their will, while those things which are most useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_24" id="PageII_xv_24">[24-31]</a></span> to
them among the products of Lazica these fellows demand to buy, as they
put it, from us, the price being determined in both cases by the
judgment of the stronger party. And thus they are robbing us of all
our gold as well as of the necessities of life, using the fair name of
trade, but in fact oppressing us as thoroughly as they possibly can.
And there has been set over us as ruler a huckster who has made our
destitution a kind of business by virtue of the authority of his
office. The cause of our revolt, therefore, being of this sort, has
justice on its side; but the advantage which you yourselves will gain
if you receive the request of the Lazi we shall forthwith tell. To the
realm of Persia you will add a most ancient kingdom, and as a result
of this you will have the power of your sway extended, and it will
come about that you will have a part in the sea of the Romans through
our land, and after thou hast built ships in this sea, O King, it will
be possible for thee with no trouble to set foot in the palace in
Byzantium. For there is no obstacle between. And one might add that
the plundering of the land of the Romans every year by the barbarians
along the boundary will be under your control. For surely you also are
acquainted with the fact that up till now the land of the Lazi has
been a bulwark against the Caucasus mountains. So with justice leading
the way, and advantage added thereto, we consider that not to receive
our words with favour would be wholly contrary to good judgment.&quot; So
spoke the envoys.</p>

<p>And Chosroes, delighted by their words, promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xv_31" id="PageII_xv_31">[31-2]</a></span> to protect the
Lazi, and enquired of the envoys whether it was possible for him to
enter the land of Colchis with a large army. For he said that
previously he had heard many persons report that the land was
exceedingly hard to traverse even for an unimpeded traveller, being
extremely rugged and covered very extensively by thick forests of
wide-spreading trees. But the envoys stoutly maintained to him that
the way through the country would be easy for the whole Persian army,
if they cut the trees and threw them into the places which were made
difficult by precipices. And they promised that they themselves would
be guides of the route, and would take the lead in this work for the
Persians. Encouraged by this suggestion, Chosroes gathered a great
army and made his preparations for the inroad, not disclosing the plan
to the Persians except those alone to whom he was accustomed to
communicate his secrets, and commanding the envoys to tell no one what
was being done; and he pretended that he was setting out into Iberia,
in order to settle matters there; for a Hunnic tribe, he kept saying
in explanation, had assailed the Persian domain at that point.</p>
<br />
<p>XVI</p>

<p>At this time Belisarius had arrived in Mesopotamia and was gathering
his army from every quarter, and he also kept sending men into the
land of Persia to act as spies. And wishing himself to encounter
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvi_2" id="PageII_xvi_2">[2-8]</a></span> enemy there, if they should again make an incursion into the
land of the Romans, he was organizing on the spot and equipping the
soldiers, who were for the most part without either arms or armour,
and in terror of the name of the Persians. Now the spies returned and
declared that for the present there would be no invasion of the enemy;
for Chosroes was occupied elsewhere with a war against the Huns. And
Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy
immediately with his whole army. Arethas also came to him with a large
force of Saracens, and besides the emperor wrote a letter instructing
him to invade the enemy's country with all speed. He therefore called
together all the officers in Daras and spoke as follows: &quot;I know that
all of you, my fellow officers, are experienced in many wars, and I
have brought you together at the present time, not in order to stir up
your minds against the enemy by addressing to you any reminder or
exhortation (for I think that you need no speech that prompts to
daring), but in order that we may deliberate together among ourselves,
and choose rather the course which may seem fairest and best for the
cause of the emperor. For war is wont to succeed by reason of careful
planning more than by anything else. Now it is necessary that those
who gather for deliberation should make their minds entirely free from
modesty and from fear. For fear, by paralyzing those who have fallen
into it, does not allow the reason to choose the nobler part, and
modesty obscures what has been seen to be the better course and leads
investigation the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvi_8" id="PageII_xvi_8">[8-17]</a></span> opposite way. If, therefore, it seems to you that
any purpose has been formed either by our mighty emperor or by me
concerning the present situation, let no thought of this enter your
minds. For, as for him, he is altogether ignorant of what is being
done, and is therefore unable to adapt his moves to opportune moments;
there is therefore no fear but that in going contrary to him we shall
do that which will be of advantage to his cause. And as for me, since
I am human, and have come here from the West after a long interval,
it is impossible that some of the necessary things should not escape
me. So it behoves you, without any too modest regard for my opinion,
to say outright whatever is going to be of advantage for ourselves and
for the emperor. Now in the beginning, fellow officers, we came here
in order to prevent the enemy from making any invasion into our land,
but at the present time, since things have gone better for us than we
had hoped, it is possible for us to make his land the subject of our
deliberation. And now that you have been gathered together for this
purpose, it is fair, I think, that you should tell without any
concealment what seems to each one best and most advantageous.&quot; Thus
spoke Belisarius.</p>

<p>And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation
against the enemy's country. And their opinion was followed
immediately by the whole council. Rhecithancus, however, and
Theoctistus, the commanders of the troops in Lebanon, said that, while
they too had the same wish as the others concerning the invasion, they
feared that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvi_17" id="PageII_xvi_17">[17-2]</a></span> they abandoned the country of Phoenicia and Syria,
Alamoundaras would plunder it at his leisure, and that the emperor
would be angry with them because they had not guarded and kept
unplundered the territory under their command, and for this reason
they were quite unwilling to join the rest of the army in the
invasion. But Belisarius said that the opinion of these two men was
not in the least degree true; for it was the season of the vernal
equinox, and at this season the Saracens always dedicated about two
months to their god, and during this time never undertook any inroad
into the land of others. Agreeing, therefore, to release both of them
with their followers within sixty days, he commanded them also to
follow with the rest of the army. So Belisarius was making his
preparation for the invasion with great zeal.</p>
<br />
<p>XVII</p>

<p>But Chosroes and the Median army, after crossing Iberia, reached the
territory of Lazica under the leadership of the envoys; there with no
one to withstand them they began to cut down the trees which grow
thickly over that very mountainous region, rising to a great height,
and spreading out their branches remarkably, so that they made the
country absolutely impassable for the army; and these they threw into
the rough places, and thus rendered the road altogether easy. And when
they arrived in the centre of Colchis (the place where the tales of
the poets say that the adventure of Medea and Jason took place),
Goubazes, the king of the Lazi, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvii_2" id="PageII_xvii_2">[2-9]</a></span> and did obeisance to Chosroes,
the son of Cabades, as Lord, putting himself together with his palace
and all Lazica into his hand.</p>

<p>Now there is a coast city named Petra in Colchis, on the sea which is
called the Euxine, which in former times had been a place of no
importance, but which the Emperor Justinian had rendered strong and
otherwise conspicuous by means of the circuit-wall and other
buildings which he erected. When Chosroes ascertained that the Roman
army was in that place with John, he sent an army and a general,
Aniabedes, against them in order to capture the place at the first
onset. But John, upon learning of their approach, gave orders that no
one should go outside the fortifications nor allow himself to be seen
from the parapet by the enemy, and he armed the whole army and
stationed them in the vicinity of the gates, commanding them to keep
silence and not allow the least sound of any kind to escape from them.
So the Persians came close to the fortifications, and since nothing of
the enemy was either seen or heard by them they thought that the
Romans had abandoned the city and left it destitute of men. For this
reason they closed in still more around the fortifications, so as to
set up ladders immediately, since no one was defending the wall. And
neither seeing nor hearing anything of the enemy, they sent to
Chosroes and explained the situation. And he sent the greater part of
the army, commanding them to make an attempt upon the fortifications
from all sides, and he directed one of the officers to make use of the
engine known as a ram around the gate, while he himself, seated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvii_9" id="PageII_xvii_9">[9-17]</a></span>
the hill which lies very close to the city, became a spectator of the
operations. And straightway the Romans opened the gates all of a
sudden, and unexpectedly fell upon and slew great numbers of the
enemy, and especially those stationed about the ram; the rest with
difficulty made their escape together with the general and were saved.
And Chosroes, filled with rage, impaled Aniabedes, since he had been
outgeneralled by John, a tradesman and an altogether unwarlike man.
But some say that not Aniabedes, but the officer commanding the men
who were working the ram was impaled. And he himself broke camp with
the whole army, and coming close to the fortifications of Petra, made
camp and began a siege. On the following day he went completely around
the fortifications, and since he suspected that they could not support
a very strong attack, he decided to storm the wall. And bringing up
the whole army there, he opened the action, commanding all to shoot
with their bows against the parapet. The Romans, meanwhile, in
defending themselves, made use of their engines of war and all their
bows. At first, then, the Persians did the Romans little harm,
although they were shooting their arrows thick and fast, while at the
same time they suffered severely at the hands of the Romans, since
they were being shot at from an elevation. But later on (since it was
fated that Petra be captured by Chosroes), John by some chance was
shot in the neck and died, and as a result of this the other Romans
ceased to care for anything. Then indeed the barbarians withdrew to
their camp; for it was already growing dark; but on the following day
they planned to assail the fortifications by an excavation, as
follows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvii_18" id="PageII_xvii_18">[18-26]</a></span></p>

<p>The city of Petra is on one side inaccessible on account of the sea,
and on the other on account of the sheer cliffs which rise there on
every hand; indeed it is from this circumstance that the city has
received the name it bears. And it has only one approach on the level
ground, and that not very broad; for exceedingly high cliffs overhang
it on either side. At that point those who formerly built the city
provided that that portion of the wall should not be open to attack by
making long walls which ran along beside either cliff and guarded the
approach for a great distance. And they built two towers, one in each
of these walls, not following the customary plan, but as follows. They
refused to allow the space in the middle of the structure to be empty,
but constructed the entire towers from the ground up to a great height
of very large stones which fitted together, in order that they might
never be shaken down by a ram or any other engine. Such, then, are the
fortifications of Petra. But the Persians secretly made a tunnel into
the earth and got under one of the two towers, and from there carried
out many of the stones and in their place put wood, which a little
later they burned. And the flame, rising little by little, weakened
the stones, and all of a sudden shook the whole tower violently and
straightway brought it down to the ground. And the Romans who were on
the tower perceived what was being done in sufficient time so that
they did not fall with it to the ground, but they fled and got inside
the city wall. And now it was possible for the enemy to storm the wall
from the level, and thus with no trouble to take the city by force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xvii_26" id="PageII_xvii_26">[26-5]</a></span>
The Romans, therefore, in terror, opened negotiations with the
barbarians, and receiving from Chosroes pledges concerning their lives
and their property, they surrendered to him both themselves and the
city. Thus Chosroes captured Petra.
<span class="sidenote">541 A.D.</span>
And finding the treasures of John,
which were extremely rich, he took them himself, but besides this
neither he himself nor anyone else of the Persians touched anything,
and the Romans, retaining their own possessions, mingled with the
Median army.</p>
<br />
<p>XVIII</p>

<p>Meantime Belisarius and the Roman army, having learned nothing of what
was being done there, were going in excellent order from the city of
Daras toward Nisibis. And when they had reached the middle of their
journey, Belisarius led the army to the right where there were
abundant springs of water and level ground sufficient for all to camp
upon. And there he gave orders to make a camp at about forty-two
stades from the city of Nisibis. But all the others marvelled greatly
that he did not wish to camp close to the fortifications, and some
were quite unwilling to follow him. Belisarius therefore addressed
those of the officers who were about him thus: &quot;It was not my wish to
disclose to all what I am thinking. For talk carried about through a
camp cannot keep secrets, for it advances little by little until it is
carried out even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xviii_5" id="PageII_xviii_5">[5-14]</a></span> enemy. But seeing that the majority of you
are allowing yourselves to act in a most disorderly manner, and that
each one wishes to be himself supreme commander in the war, I shall
now say among you things about which one ought to keep silence,
mentioning, however, this first, that when many in an army follow
independent judgments it is impossible that anything needful be done.
Now I think that Chosroes, in going against other barbarians, has by
no means left his own land without sufficient protection, and in
particular this city which is of the first rank and is set as a
defence to his whole land. In this city I know well that he has
stationed soldiers in such number and of such valour as to be
sufficient to stand in the way of our assaults. And the proof of this
you have near at hand. For he put in command of these men the general
Nabedes, who, after Chosroes himself at least, seems to be first among
the Persians in glory and in every other sort of honour. This man, I
believe, will both make trial of our strength and will permit of our
passing by on no other condition than that he be defeated by us in
battle. If, therefore, the conflict should be close by the city, the
struggle will not be even for us and the Persians. For they, coming
out from their stronghold against us, in case of success, should it so
happen, will feel unlimited confidence in assailing us, and in case of
defeat they will easily escape from our attack. For we shall only be
able to pursue them a short distance, and from this no harm will come
to the city, which you surely see cannot be captured by storming the
wall when soldiers are defending it. But if the enemy engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xviii_14" id="PageII_xviii_14">[14-19]</a></span> with
us here and we conquer them, I have great hopes, fellow officers, of
capturing the city. For while our antagonists are fleeing a long way,
we shall either mingle with them and rush inside the gates with them,
as is probable, or we shall anticipate them and compel them to turn
and escape to some other place, and thus render Nisibis without its
defenders easy of capture for us.&quot;</p>

<p>When Belisarius had said this, all the others except Peter were
convinced, and they made camp and remained with him. He, however,
associating with himself John, who commanded the troops in Mesopotamia
and had no small part of the army, came up to a position not far
removed from the fortifications, about ten stades away, and remained
quietly there. But Belisarius marshalled the men who were with him as
if for combat, and sent word to Peter and his men also to hold
themselves in array for battle, until he himself should give the
signal; and he said that he knew well that the barbarians would attack
them about midday, remembering, as they surely would, that while they
themselves are accustomed to partake of food in the late afternoon,
the Romans do so about midday. So Belisarius gave this warning; but
Peter and his men disregarded his commands, and about midday, being
distressed by the sun (for the place is exceedingly dry and hot), they
stacked their arms, and with never a thought of the enemy began to go
about in disorderly fashion and eat gourds which grew there. And when
this was observed by Nabedes, he led the Persian army running at full
speed against them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xviii_20" id="PageII_xviii_20">[20-26]</a></span> And the Romans, since they did not fail to
observe that the Persians were coming out of the fortifications (for
they were seen clearly because moving over a level plain), sent to
Belisarius urging him to support them, and they themselves snatched up
their arms, and in disorder and confusion confronted their foe. But
Belisarius and his men, even before the messenger had reached them,
discovered by the dust the attack of the Persians, and went to the
rescue on the run. And when the Persians came up, the Romans did not
withstand their onset, but were routed without any difficulty, and the
Persians, following close upon them, killed fifty men, and seized and
kept the standard of Peter. And they would have slain them all in this
pursuit, for the Romans had no thought of resistance, if Belisarius
and the army with him had not come upon them and prevented it. For as
the Goths, first of all, came upon them with long spears in close
array, the Persians did not await their attack but beat a hasty
retreat. And the Romans together with the Goths followed them up and
slew a hundred and fifty men. For the pursuit was only of short
duration, and the others quickly got inside the fortifications. Then
indeed all the Romans withdrew to the camp of Belisarius, and the
Persians on the following day set up on a tower instead of a trophy
the standard of Peter, and hanging sausages from it they taunted the
enemy with laughter; however, they no longer dared to come out against
them, but they guarded the city securely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_1" id="PageII_xix_1">[1-8]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>XIX</p>

<p>And Belisarius, seeing that Nisibis was exceedingly strong, and having
no hope regarding its capture, was eager to go forward, in order that
he might do the enemy some damage by a sudden inroad. Accordingly he
broke camp and moved forward with the whole army. And after
accomplishing a day's journey, they came upon a fortress which the
Persians call Sisauranon. There were in that place besides the
numerous population eight hundred horsemen, the best of the Persians,
who were keeping guard under command of a man of note, Bleschames by
name. And the Romans made camp close by the fortress and began a
siege, but, upon making an assault upon the fortifications, they were
beaten back, losing many men in the fight. For the wall happened to be
extremely strong, and the barbarians defended it against their
assailants with the greatest vigour. Belisarius therefore called
together all the officers and spoke as follows: &quot;Experience in many
wars, fellow officers, has made it possible for us in difficult
situations to foresee what will come to pass, and has made us capable
of avoiding disaster by choosing the better course. You understand,
therefore, how great a mistake it is for an army to proceed into a
hostile land, when many strongholds and many fighting men in them have
been left in the rear. Now exactly this has happened to us in the
present case. For if we continue our advance, some of the enemy from
this place as well as from the city of Nisibis will follow us secretly
and will, in all probability, handle us<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_8" id="PageII_xix_8">[8-15]</a></span> roughly in places which
are for them conveniently adapted for an ambuscade or some other sort
of attack. And if, by any chance, a second army confronts us and opens
battle, it will be necessary for us to array ourselves against both,
and we should thus suffer irreparable harm at their hands. And in
saying this I do not mention the fact that if we fail in the
engagement, should it so happen, we shall after that have absolutely
no way of return left to the land of the Romans. Let us not therefore
by reason of most ill-considered haste seem to have been our own
despoilers, nor by our eagerness for strife do harm to the cause of
the Romans. For stupid daring leads to destruction, but discreet
hesitation is well adapted always to save those who adopt such a
course. Let us therefore establish ourselves here and endeavour to
capture this fortress, and let Arethas with his forces be sent into
the country of Assyria. For the Saracens are by nature unable to storm
a wall, but the cleverest of all men at plundering. And some of the
soldiers who are good fighters will join them in the invasion, so
that, if no opposition presents itself to them, they may overwhelm
those who fall in their way, and if any hostile force encounters
them, they may be saved easily by retiring to us. And after we have
captured the fortress, if God wills, then with the whole army let us
cross the River Tigris, without having to fear mischief from anyone in
our rear, and knowing well how matters stand with the Assyrians.&quot;</p>

<p>These words of Belisarius seemed to all well spoken, and he
straightway put the plan into execution. Accordingly he commanded
Arethas with<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_15" id="PageII_xix_15">[15-23]</a></span> his troops to advance into Assyria, and with them he
sent twelve hundred soldiers, the most of whom were from among his own
guard, putting two guardsmen in command of them, Trajan and John who
was called the Glutton, both capable warriors. These men he directed
to obey Arethas in everything they did, and he commanded Arethas to
pillage all that lay before him and then return to the camp and report
how matters stood with the Assyrians with regard to military strength.
So Arethas and his men crossed the River Tigris and entered Assyria.
There they found a goodly land and one which had been free from
plunder for a long time, and undefended besides; and moving rapidly
they pillaged many of the places there and secured a great amount of
rich plunder. And at that time Belisarius captured some of the
Persians and learned from them that those who were inside the fortress
were altogether out of provisions. For they do not observe the custom
which is followed in the cities of Daras and Nisibis, where they put
away the annual food-supply in public store-houses, and now that a
hostile army had fallen upon them unexpectedly they had not
anticipated the event by carrying in any of the necessities of life.
And since a great number of persons had taken refuge suddenly in the
fortress, they were naturally hard pressed by the want of provisions.
When Belisarius learned this, he sent George, a man of the greatest
discretion with whom he shared his secrets, to test the men of the
place, in the hope that he might be able to arrange some terms of
surrender and thus take the place. And George succeeded, after
addressing to them many<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_23" id="PageII_xix_23">[23-31]</a></span> words of exhortation and of kindly
invitation, in persuading them to take pledges for their safety and to
deliver themselves and the fortress to the Romans. Thus Belisarius
captured Sisauranon, and the inhabitants, all of whom were Christians
and of Roman origin, he released unscathed, but the Persians he sent
with Bleschames to Byzantium, and razed the fortification wall of the
fortress to the ground. And the emperor not long afterwards sent these
Persians and Bleschames to Italy to fight against the Goths. Such,
then, was the course of events which had to do with the fortress of
Sisauranon.</p>

<p>But Arethas, fearing lest he should be despoiled of his booty by the
Romans, was now unwilling to return to the camp. So he sent some of
his followers ostensibly for the purpose of reconnoitring, but
secretly commanding them to return as quickly as possible and announce
to the army that a large hostile force was at the crossing of the
river. For this reason, then, he advised Trajan and John to return by
another route to the land of the Romans.
So they did not come again to
Belisarius, but keeping the River Euphrates on the right they finally
arrived at the Theodosiopolis which is near the River Aborrhas. But
Belisarius and the Roman army, hearing nothing concerning this force,
were disturbed, and they were filled with fear and an intolerable and
exaggerated suspicion. And since much time had been consumed by them
in this siege, it came about that many of the soldiers were taken
there with a troublesome fever; for the portion of Mesopotamia which
is subject to the Persians is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_31" id="PageII_xix_31">[31-39]</a></span> extremely dry and hot. And the Romans
were not accustomed to this and especially those who came from Thrace;
and since they were living their daily life in a place where the heat
was excessive and in stuffy huts in the summer season, they became so
ill that the third part of the army were lying half-dead. The whole
army, therefore, was eager to depart from there and return as quickly
as possible to their own land, and most of all the commanders of the
troops in Lebanon, Rhecithancus and Theoctistus, who saw that the time
which was the sacred season of the Saracens had in fact already
passed. They came, indeed, frequently to Belisarius and entreated him
to release them immediately, protesting that they had given over to
Alamoundaras the country of Lebanon and Syria, and were sitting there
for no good reason.</p>

<p>Belisarius therefore called together all the officers and opened a
discussion. Then John, the son of Nicetas, rose first and spoke as
follows: &quot;Most excellent Belisarius, I consider that in all time there
has never been a general such as you are either in fortune or in
valour. And this reputation has come to prevail not alone among the
Romans, but also among all barbarians. This fair name, however, you
will preserve most securely, if you should be able to take us back
alive to the land of the Romans; for now indeed the hopes which we may
have are not bright. For I would have you look thus at the situation
of this army. The Saracens and the most efficient soldiers of the army
crossed the River Tigris, and one day, I know not how long since, they
found themselves in such a plight that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_39" id="PageII_xix_39">[39-47]</a></span> not even succeeded
in sending a messenger to us, and Rhecithancus and Theoctistus will
depart, as you see surely, believing that the army of Alamoundaras is
almost at this very moment in the midst of Phoenicia, pillaging the
whole country there. And among those who are left the sick are so
numerous that those who will care for them and convey them to the
land of the Romans are fewer in number than they are by a great deal.
Under these circumstances, if it should fall out that any hostile
force should come upon us, either while remaining here or while going
back, not a man would be able to carry back word to the Romans in
Daras of the calamity which had befallen us. For as for going forward,
I consider it impossible even to be spoken of. While, therefore, some
hope is still left, it will be of advantage both to make plans for the
return and to put the plans into action. For when men have come into
danger and especially such danger as this, it is downright folly for
them to devote their thoughts not to safety, but to opposition to the
enemy.&quot; So spoke John, and all the others expressed approval, and
becoming disorderly, they demanded that the retreat be made with all
speed. Accordingly Belisarius laid the sick in the carts and let them
lead the way, while he led the army behind them. And as soon as they
got into the land of the Romans, he learned everything which had been
done by Arethas, but he did not succeed in inflicting any punishment
upon him, for he never came into his sight again. So ended the
invasion of the Romans.</p>

<p>And after Chosroes had taken Petra, it was announced to him that
Belisarius had invaded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xix_47" id="PageII_xix_47">[47-4]</a></span> Persian territory, and the engagement
near the city of Nisibis was reported, as also the capture of the
fortress of Sisauranon, and all that the army of Arethas had done
after crossing the River Tigris. Straightway, then, he established a
garrison in Petra, and with the rest of the army and those of the
Romans who had been captured he marched away into the land of Persia.
Such, then, were the events which took place in the second invasion of
Chosroes. And Belisarius went to Byzantium at the summons of the
emperor, and passed the winter there.</p>
<br />
<p>XX</p>

<span class="sidenote">542 A.D.</span><p>At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the third
time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a mighty
army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. And Candidus, the
priest of Sergiopolis, upon learning that the Median army had come
near there, began to be afraid both for himself and for the city,
since he had by no means carried out at the appointed time the
agreement which he had made<a name="FNanchor_15_47" id="FNanchor_15_47" /><a href="#Footnote_15_47" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; accordingly he went into the camp of
the enemy and entreated Chosroes not to be angry with him because of
this. For as for money, he had never had any, and for this reason he
had not even wished in the first place to deliver the inhabitants of
Sura, and though he had supplicated the Emperor Justinian many times
on their behalf, he had failed to receive any help from him. But
Chosroes put him under guard, and, torturing him most cruelly, claimed
the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xx_4" id="PageII_xx_4">[4-14]</a></span> exact from him double the amount of money, just as had
been agreed. And Candidus entreated him to send men to Sergiopolis to
take all the treasures of the sanctuary there. And when Chosroes
followed this suggestion, Candidus sent some of his followers with
them. So the inhabitants of Sergiopolis, receiving into the city the
men sent by Chosroes, gave them many of the treasures, declaring that
nothing else was left them. But Chosroes said that these were by no
means sufficient for him, and demanded that he should receive others
still more than these. Accordingly he sent men, ostensibly to search
out with all diligence the wealth of the city, but in reality to take
possession of the city. But since it was fated that Sergiopolis should
not be taken by the Persians, one of the Saracens, who, though a
Christian, was serving under Alamoundaras, Ambrus by name, came by
night along the wall of the city, and reporting to them the whole
plan, bade them by no means receive the Persians into the city. Thus
those who were sent by Chosroes returned to him unsuccessful, and he,
boiling with anger, began to make plans to capture the city. He
accordingly sent an army of six thousand, commanding them to begin a
siege and to make assaults upon the fortifications. And this army came
there and commenced active operations, and the citizens of Sergiopolis
at first defended themselves vigorously, but later they gave up, and
in terror at the danger, they were purposing to give over the city to
the enemy. For, as it happened, they had not more than two hundred
soldiers. But Ambrus, again coming along by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xx_14" id="PageII_xx_14">[14-20]</a></span> fortifications at
night, said that within two days the Persians would raise the siege
since their water supply had failed them absolutely. For this reason
they did not by any means open negotiations with the enemy, and the
barbarians, suffering with thirst, removed from there and came to
Chosroes. However, Chosroes never released Candidus. For it was
necessary, I suppose, that since he had disregarded his sworn
agreement, he should be a priest no longer. Such, then, was the course
of these events.</p>

<p>But when Chosroes arrived at the land of the Commagenae which they
call Euphratesia, he had no desire to turn to plundering or to the
capture of any stronghold, since he had previously taken everything
before him as far as Syria, partly by capture and partly by exacting
money, as has been set forth in the preceding narrative. And his
purpose was to lead the army straight for Palestine, in order that he
might plunder all their treasures and especially those in Jerusalem.
For he had it from hearsay that this was an especially goodly land and
peopled by wealthy inhabitants. And all the Romans, both officers and
soldiers, were far from entertaining any thought of confronting the
enemy or of standing in the way of their passage, but manning their
strongholds as each one could, they thought it sufficient to preserve
them and save themselves.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians,
again sent Belisarius against them. And he came with great speed to
Euphratesia since he had no army with him, riding on the government
post-horses, which they are accustomed to call &quot;Veredi,&quot; while Justus,
the nephew of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xx_20" id="PageII_xx_20">[20-26]</a></span> emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others,
was in Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge. And when these men
heard that Belisarius was coming and was not far away, they wrote a
letter to him which ran as follows: &quot;Once more Chosroes, as you
yourself doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans,
bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing
to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near,
and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come
to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape
detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be
safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding
Hierapolis.&quot; Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not
approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is
on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and
began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the
officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: &quot;If, now,
Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against
subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and
insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly
for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of
trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately
after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some
other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally
good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to
perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xx_26" id="PageII_xx_26">[26-2]</a></span> valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a
fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But
come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the
whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits.&quot; And when
the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there
Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others
with the rest of the army came to Europum.</p>

<br />
<p>XXI</p>

<p>But Chosroes, upon learning that Belisarius with the whole Roman army
had encamped at Europum, decided not to continue his advance, but sent
one of the royal secretaries, Abandanes by name, a man who enjoyed a
great reputation for discretion, to Belisarius, in order to find out
by inspection what sort of a general he might be, but ostensibly to
make a protest because the Emperor Justinian had not sent the
ambassadors to the Persians at all in order that they might settle the
arrangements for the peace as had been agreed. When Belisarius learned
this, he did as follows. He himself picked out six thousand men of
goodly stature and especially fine physique, and set out to hunt at a
considerable distance from the camp. Then he commanded Diogenes, the
guardsman, and Adolius, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_2" id="PageII_xxi_2">[2-7]</a></span> Acacius, to cross the river with
a thousand horsemen and to move about the bank there, always making it
appear to the enemy that if they wished to cross the Euphrates and
proceed to their own land, they would never permit them to do so. This
Adolius was an Armenian by birth, and he always served the emperor
while in the palace as privy counsellor (those who enjoy this honour
are called by the Romans &quot;silentiarii&quot;), but at that time he was
commander of some Armenians. And these men did as directed.</p>

<p>Now when Belisarius had ascertained that the envoy was close at hand,
he set up a tent of some heavy cloth, of the sort which is commonly
called a &quot;pavilion,&quot; and seated himself there as one might in a
desolate place, seeking thus to indicate that he had come without any
equipment. And he arranged the soldiers as follows. On either side of
the tent were Thracians and Illyrians, with Goths beyond them, and
next to these Eruli, and finally Vandals and Moors. And their line
extended for a great distance over the plain. For they did not remain
standing always in the same place, but stood apart from one another
and kept walking about, looking carelessly and without the least
interest upon the envoy of Chosroes. And not one of them had a cloak
or any other outer garment to cover the shoulders, but they were
sauntering about clad in linen tunics and trousers, and outside these
their girdles. And each one had his horse-whip, but for weapons one
had a sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_7" id="PageII_xxi_7">[7-14]</a></span> another an axe, another an uncovered bow. And all gave
the impression that they were eager to be off on the hunt with never a
thought of anything else.
So Abandanes came into the presence of
Belisarius and said that the king Chosroes was indignant because the
agreement previously made had not been kept, in that the envoys had
not been sent to him by Caesar (for thus the Persians call the emperor
of the Romans), and as a result of this Chosroes had been compelled to
come into the land of the Romans in arms. But Belisarius was not
terrified by the thought that such a multitude of barbarians were
encamped close by, nor did he experience any confusion because of the
words of the man, but with a laughing, care-free countenance he made
answer, saying: &quot;This course which Chosroes has followed on the
present occasion is not in keeping with the way men usually act. For
other men, in case a dispute should arise between themselves and any
of their neighbours, first carry on negotiations with them, and
whenever they do not receive reasonable satisfaction, then finally go
against them in war. But he first comes into the midst of the Romans,
and then begins to offer suggestions concerning peace.&quot; With such
words as these he dismissed the ambassador.</p>

<p>And when Abandanes came to Chosroes, he advised him to take his
departure with all possible speed. For he said he had met a general
who in manliness and sagacity surpassed all other men, and soldiers
such as he at least had never seen, whose orderly conduct had roused
in him the greatest admiration. And he added that the contest was not
on an even footing as regards risk for him and for Belisarius, for
there was this difference, that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_14" id="PageII_xxi_14">[14-18]</a></span> conquered, he himself would
conquer the slave of Caesar, but if he by any chance were defeated, he
would bring great disgrace upon his kingdom and upon the race of the
Persians; and again the Romans, if conquered, could easily save
themselves in strongholds and in their own land, while if the Persians
should meet with any reverse, not even a messenger would escape to the
land of the Persians. Chosroes was convinced by this admonition and
wished to turn back to his own country, but he found himself in a very
perplexing situation. For he supposed that the crossing of the river
was being guarded by the enemy, and he was unable to march back by the
same road, which was entirely destitute of human habitation, since the
supplies which they had at the first when they invaded the land of the
Romans had already entirely failed them. At last after long
consideration it seemed to him most advantageous to risk a battle and
get to the opposite side, and to make the journey through a land
abounding in all good things. Now Belisarius knew well that not even a
hundred thousand men would ever be sufficient to check the crossing of
Chosroes. For the river at many places along there can be crossed in
boats very easily, and even apart from this the Persian army was too
strong to be excluded from the crossing by an enemy numerically
insignificant. But he had at first commanded the troops of Diogenes
and Adolius, together with the thousand horsemen, to move about the
bank at that point in order to confuse the barbarian by a feeling of
helplessness. But after frightening this same barbarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_18" id="PageII_xxi_18">[18-26]</a></span> as I have
said, Belisarius feared lest there should be some obstacle in the way
of his departing from the land of the Romans. For it seemed to him a
most significant achievement to have driven away from there the army
of Chosroes, without risking any battle against so many myriads of
barbarians with soldiers who were very few in number and who were in
abject terror of the Median army. For this reason he commanded
Diogenes and Adolius to remain quiet.</p>

<p>Chosroes, accordingly, constructed a bridge with great celerity and
crossed the River Euphrates suddenly with his whole army. For the
Persians are able to cross all rivers without the slightest difficulty
because when they are on the march they have in readiness hook-shaped
irons with which they fasten together long timbers, and with the help
of these they improvise a bridge on the spur of the moment wherever
they may desire. And as soon as he had reached the land on the
opposite side, he sent to Belisarius and said that he, for his part,
had bestowed a favour upon the Romans in the withdrawal of the Median
army, and that he was expecting the envoys from them, who ought to
present themselves to him at no distant time. Then Belisarius also
with the whole Roman army crossed the River Euphrates and immediately
sent to Chosroes. And when the messengers came into his presence, they
commended him highly for his withdrawal and promised that envoys would
come to him promptly from the emperor, who would arrange with him that
the terms which had previously been agreed upon concerning the peace
should be put into effect. And they asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_26" id="PageII_xxi_26">[26-30]</a></span> of him that he treat the
Romans as his friends in his journey through their land. This too he
agreed to carry out, if they should give him some one of their notable
men as a hostage to make this compact binding, in order that they
might carry out their agreement. So the envoys returned to Belisarius
and reported the words of Chosroes, and he came to Edessa and chose
John, the son of Basilius, the most illustrious of all the inhabitants
of Edessa in birth and in wealth, and straightway sent him, much
against his will, as a hostage to Chosroes. And the Romans were loud
in their praises of Belisarius and he seemed to have achieved greater
glory in their eyes by this affair than when he brought Gelimer or
Vittigis captive to Byzantium. For in reality it was an achievement of
great importance and one deserving great praise, that, at a time when
all the Romans were panic-stricken with fear and were hiding
themselves in their defences, and Chosroes with a mighty army had come
into the midst of the Roman domain, a general with only a few men,
coming in hot haste from Byzantium just at that moment, should have
set his camp over against that of the Persian king, and that Chosroes
unexpectedly, either through fear of fortune or of the valour of the
man or even because deceived by some tricks, should no longer continue
his advance, but should in reality take to flight, though pretending
to be seeking peace.</p>

<p>But in the meantime Chosroes, disregarding the agreement, took the
city of Callinicus which was entirely without defenders. For the
Romans, seeing that the wall of this city was altogether unsound<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxi_30" id="PageII_xxi_30">[30-1]</a></span>
and easy of capture, were tearing down portions of it in turn and
restoring them with new construction. Now just at that time they had
torn down one section of it and had not yet built in this interval;
when, therefore, they learned that the enemy were close at hand, they
carried out the most precious of their treasures, and the wealthy
inhabitants withdrew to other strongholds, while the rest without
soldiers remained where they were. And it happened that great numbers
of farmers had gathered there. These Chosroes enslaved and razed
everything to the ground. A little later, upon receiving the hostage,
John, he retired to his own country. And the Armenians who had
submitted to Chosroes received pledges from the Romans and came with
Bassaces to Byzantium. Such was the fortune of the Romans in the third
invasion of Chosroes. And Belisarius came to Byzantium at the summons
of the emperor, in order to be sent again to Italy, since the
situation there was already full of difficulties for the Romans.</p>
<br />
<p>XXII</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">542 A.D.</span>During these times there was a pestilence, by which the whole human
race came near to being annihilated. Now in the case of all other
scourges sent from Heaven some explanation of a cause might be given
by daring men, such as the many theories propounded by those who are
clever in these matters; for they love to conjure up causes which are
absolutely incomprehensible to man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_1" id="PageII_xxii_1">[1-7]</a></span> to fabricate outlandish
theories of natural philosophy, knowing well that they are saying
nothing sound, but considering it sufficient for them, if they
completely deceive by their argument some of those whom they meet and
persuade them to their view. But for this calamity it is quite
impossible either to express in words or to conceive in thought any
explanation, except indeed to refer it to God. For it did not come in
a part of the world nor upon certain men, nor did it confine itself to
any season of the year, so that from such circumstances it might be
possible to find subtle explanations of a cause, but it embraced the
entire world, and blighted the lives of all men, though differing from
one another in the most marked degree, respecting neither sex nor age.
For much as men differ with regard to places in which they live, or in
the law of their daily life, or in natural bent, or in active
pursuits, or in whatever else man differs from man, in the case of
this disease alone the difference availed naught. And it attacked some
in the summer season, others in the winter, and still others at the
other times of the year. Now let each one express his own judgment
concerning the matter, both sophist and astrologer, but as for me, I
shall proceed to tell where this disease originated and the manner in
which it destroyed men.</p>

<p>It started from the Aegyptians who dwell in Pelusium. Then it divided
and moved in one direction towards Alexandria and the rest of Aegypt,
and in the other direction it came to Palestine on the borders of
Aegypt; and from there it spread over the whole world, always moving
forward and travelling at times favourable to it. For it seemed to
move by<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_7" id="PageII_xxii_7">[7-11]</a></span> fixed arrangement, and to tarry for a specified time in
each country, casting its blight slightingly upon none, but spreading
in either direction right out to the ends of the world, as if fearing
lest some corner of the earth might escape it. For it left neither
island nor cave nor mountain ridge which had human inhabitants; and if
it had passed by any land, either not affecting the men there or
touching them in indifferent fashion, still at a later time it came
back; then those who dwelt round about this land, whom formerly it had
afflicted most sorely, it did not touch at all, but it did not remove
from the place in question until it had given up its just and proper
tale of dead, so as to correspond exactly to the number destroyed at
the earlier time among those who dwelt round about. And this disease
always took its start from the coast, and from there went up to the
interior. And in the second year it reached Byzantium in the middle of
spring, where it happened that I was staying at that time. And it came
as follows. Apparitions of supernatural beings in human guise of every
description were seen by many persons, and those who encountered them
thought that they were struck by the man they had met in this or that
part of the body, as it happened, and immediately upon seeing this
apparition they were seized also by the disease. Now at first those
who met these creatures tried to turn them aside by uttering the
holiest of names and exorcising them in other ways as well as each one
could, but they accomplished absolutely nothing, for even in the
sanctuaries where the most of them fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_11" id="PageII_xxii_11">[11-17]</a></span> for refuge they were dying
constantly. But later on they were unwilling even to give heed to
their friends when they called to them, and they shut themselves up in
their rooms and pretended that they did not hear, although their doors
were being beaten down, fearing, obviously, that he who was calling
was one of those demons. But in the case of some the pestilence did
not come on in this way, but they saw a vision in a dream and seemed
to suffer the very same thing at the hands of the creature who stood
over them, or else to hear a voice foretelling to them that they were
written down in the number of those who were to die. But with the
majority it came about that they were seized by the disease without
becoming aware of what was coming either through a waking vision or a
dream. And they were taken in the following manner. They had a sudden
fever, some when just roused from sleep, others while walking about,
and others while otherwise engaged, without any regard to what they
were doing. And the body shewed no change from its previous colour,
nor was it hot as might be expected when attacked by a fever, nor
indeed did any inflammation set in, but the fever was of such a
languid sort from its commencement and up till evening that neither to
the sick themselves nor to a physician who touched them would it
afford any suspicion of danger. It was natural, therefore, that not
one of those who had contracted the disease expected to die from it.
But on the same day in some cases, in others on the following day, and
in the rest not many days later, a bubonic swelling developed; and
this took place not only in the particular part of the body which is
called &quot;boubon,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_48" id="FNanchor_16_48" /><a href="#Footnote_16_48" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_17" id="PageII_xxii_17">[17-23]</a></span> that is, below the abdomen, but also inside
the armpit, and in some cases also beside the ears, and at different
points on the thighs.</p>

<p>Up to this point, then, everything went in about the same way with all
who had taken the disease. But from then on very marked differences
developed; and I am unable to say whether the cause of this diversity
of symptoms was to be found in the difference in bodies, or in the
fact that it followed the wish of Him who brought the disease into the
world. For there ensued with some a deep coma, with others a violent
delirium, and in either case they suffered the characteristic symptoms
of the disease. For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot
all those who were familiar to them and seemed to be sleeping
constantly. And if anyone cared for them, they would eat without
waking, but some also were neglected, and these would die directly
through lack of sustenance. But those who were seized with delirium
suffered from insomnia and were victims of a distorted imagination;
for they suspected that men were coming upon them to destroy them, and
they would become excited and rush off in flight, crying out at the
top of their voices. And those who were attending them were in a state
of constant exhaustion and had a most difficult time of it throughout.
For this reason everybody pitied them no less than the sufferers, not
because they were threatened by the pestilence in going near it (for
neither physicians nor other persons were found to contract this
malady through contact with the sick or with the dead, for many who
were constantly engaged either in burying or in attending those in no
way connected with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_23" id="PageII_xxii_23">[23-29]</a></span> held out in the performance of this service
beyond all expectation, while with many others the disease came on
without warning and they died straightway); but they pitied them
because of the great hardships which they were undergoing. For when
the patients fell from their beds and lay rolling upon the floor,
they, kept patting them back in place, and when they were struggling
to rush headlong out of their houses, they would force them back by
shoving and pulling against them. And when water chanced to be near,
they wished to fall into it, not so much because of a desire for drink
(for the most of them rushed into the sea), but the cause was to be
found chiefly in the diseased state of their minds. They had also
great difficulty in the matter of eating, for they could not easily
take food. And many perished through lack of any man to care for them,
for they were either overcome by hunger, or threw themselves down from
a height. And in those cases where neither coma nor delirium came on,
the bubonic swelling became mortified and the sufferer, no longer able
to endure the pain, died. And one would suppose that in all cases the
same thing would have been true, but since they were not at all in
their senses, some were quite unable to feel the pain; for owing to
the troubled condition of their minds they lost all sense of feeling.</p>

<p>Now some of the physicians who were at a loss because the symptoms
were not understood, supposing that the disease centred in the bubonic
swellings, decided to investigate the bodies of the dead. And upon
opening some of the swellings, they found a strange sort of carbuncle
that had grown inside them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_30" id="PageII_xxii_30">[30-36]</a></span></p>

<p>Death came in some cases immediately, in others after many days; and
with some the body broke out with black pustules about as large as a
lentil and these did not survive even one day, but all succumbed
immediately. With many also a vomiting of blood ensued without visible
cause and straightway brought death. Moreover I am able to declare
this, that the most illustrious physicians predicted that many would
die, who unexpectedly escaped entirely from suffering shortly
afterwards, and that they declared that many would be saved, who were
destined to be carried off almost immediately. So it was that in this
disease there was no cause which came within the province of human
reasoning; for in all cases the issue tended to be something
unaccountable. For example, while some were helped by bathing, others
were harmed in no less degree. And of those who received no care many
died, but others, contrary to reason, were saved. And again, methods
of treatment shewed different results with different patients. Indeed
the whole matter may be stated thus, that no device was discovered by
man to save himself, so that either by taking precautions he should
not suffer, or that when the malady had assailed him he should get the
better of it; but suffering came without warning and recovery was due
to no external cause.</p>

<p>And in the case of women who were pregnant death could be certainly
foreseen if they were taken with the disease. For some died through
miscarriage, but others perished immediately at the time of birth with
the infants they bore. However, they say that three women in
confinement<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxii_36" id="PageII_xxii_36">[36-4]</a></span> survived though their children perished, and that one
woman died at the very time of child-birth but that the child was born
and survived.</p>

<p>Now in those cases where the swelling rose to an unusual size and a
discharge of pus had set in, it came about that they escaped from the
disease and survived, for clearly the acute condition of the carbuncle
had found relief in this direction, and this proved to be in general
an indication of returning health; but in cases where the swelling
preserved its former appearance there ensued those troubles which I
have just mentioned. And with some of them it came about that the
thigh was withered, in which case, though the swelling was there, it
did not develop the least suppuration. With others who survived the
tongue did not remain unaffected, and they lived on either lisping or
speaking incoherently and with difficulty.</p>
<br />
<p>XXIII</p>

<p>Now the disease in Byzantium ran a course of four months, and its
greatest virulence lasted about three. And at first the deaths were a
little more than the normal, then the mortality rose still higher, and
afterwards the tale of dead reached five thousand each day, and again
it even came to ten thousand and still more than that. Now in the
beginning each man attended to the burial of the dead of his own
house, and these they threw even into the tombs of others, either
escaping detection or using violence; but afterwards confusion and
disorder everywhere became complete. For slaves remained destitute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiii_4" id="PageII_xxiii_4">[4-10]</a></span>
masters, and men who in former times were very prosperous were
deprived of the service of their domestics who were either sick or
dead, and many houses became completely destitute of human
inhabitants. For this reason it came about that some of the notable
men of the city because of the universal destitution remained unburied
for many days.</p>

<p>And it fell to the lot of the emperor, as was natural, to make
provision for the trouble. He therefore detailed soldiers from the
palace and distributed money, commanding Theodorus to take charge of
this work; this man held the position of announcer of imperial
messages, always announcing to the emperor the petitions of his
clients, and declaring to them in turn whatever his wish was. In the
Latin tongue the Romans designate this office by the term
&quot;referendarius.&quot; So those who had not as yet fallen into complete
destitution in their domestic affairs attended individually to the
burial of those connected with them. But Theodorus, by giving out the
emperor's money and by making further expenditures from his own purse,
kept burying the bodies which were not cared for. And when it came
about that all the tombs which had existed previously were filled with
the dead, then they dug up all the places about the city one after the
other, laid the dead there, each one as he could, and departed; but
later on those who were making these trenches, no longer able to keep
up with the number of the dying, mounted the towers of the
fortifications in Sycae,<a name="FNanchor_17_49" id="FNanchor_17_49" /><a href="#Footnote_17_49" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and tearing off the roofs threw the
bodies in there in complete disorder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiii_10" id="PageII_xxiii_10">[10-15]</a></span> and they piled them up just
as each one happened to fall, and filled practically all the towers
with corpses, and then covered them again with their roofs. As a
result of this an evil stench pervaded the city and distressed the
inhabitants still more, and especially whenever the wind blew fresh
from that quarter.</p>

<p>At that time all the customary rites of burial were overlooked. For
the dead were not carried out escorted by a procession in the
customary manner, nor were the usual chants sung over them, but it was
sufficient if one carried on his shoulders the body of one of the dead
to the parts of the city which bordered on the sea and flung him down;
and there the corpses would be thrown upon skiffs in a heap, to be
conveyed wherever it might chance. At that time, too, those of the
population who had formerly been members of the factions laid aside
their mutual enmity and in common they attended to the burial rites of
the dead, and they carried with their own hands the bodies of those
who were no connections of theirs and buried them. Nay, more, those
who in times past used to take delight in devoting themselves to
pursuits both shameful and base, shook off the unrighteousness of
their daily lives and practised the duties of religion with diligence,
not so much because they had learned wisdom at last nor because they
had become all of a sudden lovers of virtue, as it were&mdash;for when
qualities have become fixed in men by nature or by the training of a
long period of time, it is impossible for them to lay them aside thus
lightly, except, indeed, some divine influence for good has breathed
upon them&mdash;but then all, so to speak, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiii_15" id="PageII_xxiii_15">[15-19]</a></span> thoroughly terrified by
the things which were happening, and supposing that they would die
immediately, did, as was natural, learn respectability for a season by
sheer necessity. Therefore as soon as they were rid of the disease and
were saved, and already supposed that they were in security, since the
curse had moved on to other peoples, then they turned sharply about
and reverted once more to their baseness of heart, and now, more than
before, they make a display of the inconsistency of their conduct,
altogether surpassing themselves in villainy and in lawlessness of
every sort. For one could insist emphatically without falsehood that
this disease, whether by chance or by some providence, chose out with
exactitude the worst men and let them go free. But these things were
displayed to the world in later times.</p>

<p>During that time it seemed no easy thing to see any man in the streets
of Byzantium, but all who had the good fortune to be in health were
sitting in their houses, either attending the sick or mourning the
dead. And if one did succeed in meeting a man going out, he was
carrying one of the dead. And work of every description ceased, and
all the trades were abandoned by the artisans, and all other work as
well, such as each had in hand. Indeed in a city which was simply
abounding in all good things starvation almost absolute was running
riot. Certainly it seemed a difficult and very notable thing to have a
sufficiency of bread or of anything else; so that with some of the
sick it appeared that the end of life came about sooner than it should
have come by reason of the lack of the necessities of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiii_19" id="PageII_xxiii_19">[19-4]</a></span> And, to
put all in a word, it was not possible to see a single man in
Byzantium clad in the chlamys,<a name="FNanchor_18_50" id="FNanchor_18_50" /><a href="#Footnote_18_50" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and especially when the emperor
became ill (for he too had a swelling of the groin), but in a city
which held dominion over the whole Roman empire every man was wearing
clothes befitting private station and remaining quietly at home. Such
was the course of the pestilence in the Roman empire at large as well
as in Byzantium. And it fell also upon the land of the Persians and
visited all the other barbarians besides.</p>
<br />
<p>XXIV</p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">545 A.D.</span>


Now it happened that Chosroes had come from Assyria to a place toward
the north called Adarbiganon, from which he was planning to make an
invasion into the Roman domain through Persarmenia. In that place is
the great sanctuary of fire, which the Persians reverence above all
other gods. There the fire is guarded unquenched by the Magi, and they
perform carefully a great number of sacred rites, and in particular
they consult an oracle on those matters which are of the greatest
importance. This is the fire which the Romans worshipped under the
name of Hestia<a name="FNanchor_19_51" id="FNanchor_19_51" /><a href="#Footnote_19_51" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in ancient times. There someone who had been sent
from Byzantium to Chosroes announced that Constantianus and Sergius
would come before him directly as envoys to arrange the treaty. Now
these two men were both trained speakers and exceedingly clever;
Constantianus was an Illyrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiv_4" id="PageII_xxiv_4">[4-10]</a></span> by birth, and Sergius was from the
city of Edessa in Mesopotamia. And Chosroes remained quiet expecting
these men. But in the course of the journey thither Constantianus
became ill and much time was consumed; in the meantime it came about
that the pestilence fell upon the Persians. For this reason Nabedes,
who at that time held the office of general in Persarmenia, sent the
priest of the Christians in Dubios by direction of the king to
Valerianus, the general in Armenia, in order to reproach the envoys
for their tardiness and to urge the Romans with all zeal toward peace.
And he came with his brother to Armenia, and, meeting Valerianus,
declared that he himself, as a Christian, was favourably disposed
toward the Romans, and that the king Chosroes always followed his
advice in every matter; so that if the ambassadors would come with him
to the land of Persia, there would be nothing to prevent them from
arranging the peace as they wished. Thus then spoke the priest; but
the brother of the priest met Valerianus secretly and said that
Chosroes was in great straits: for his son had risen against him in an
attempt to set up a tyranny, and he himself together with the whole
Persian army had been taken with the plague; and this was the reason
why he wished just now to settle the agreement with the Romans. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiv_10" id="PageII_xxiv_10">[10-15]</a></span>
Valerianus heard this, he straightway dismissed the bishop, promising
that the envoys would come to Chosroes at no distant time, but he
himself reported the words which he had heard to the Emperor
Justinian. This led the emperor immediately to send word to him
and to Martinus and the other commanders to invade the enemy's
territory as quickly as possible. For he knew well that no one of the
enemy would stand in their way. And he commanded them to gather all in
one place and so make their invasion into Persarmenia. When the
commanders received these letters, all of them together with their
followers began to gather into the land of Armenia.</p>

<p>And already Chosroes had abandoned Adarbiganon a little before through
fear of the plague and was off with his whole army into Assyria, where
the pestilence had not as yet become epidemic. Valerianus accordingly
encamped close by Theodosiopolis with the troops under him; and with
him was arrayed Narses, who had with him Armenians and some of the
Eruli. And Martinus, the General of the East, together with Ildiger
and Theoctistus, reached the fortress of Citharizon, and fixing his
camp there, remained on the spot. This fortress is separated from
Theodosiopolis by a journey of four days. There too Peter came not
long afterwards together with Adolius and some other commanders. Now
the troops in this region were commanded by Isaac, the brother of
Narses. And Philemouth and Beros with the Eruli who were under them
came into the territory of Chorzianene, not far from the camp of
Martinus. And Justus, the emperor's nephew, and Peranius and John, the
son of Nicetas, together with Domentiolus and John, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxiv_15" id="PageII_xxiv_15">[15-1]</a></span> called
the Glutton, made camp near the place called Phison, which is close by
the boundaries of Martyropolis. Thus then were encamped the Roman
commanders with their troops; and the whole army amounted to thirty
thousand men. Now all these troops were neither gathered into one
place, nor indeed was there any general meeting for conference. But
the generals sent to each other some of their followers and began to
make enquiries concerning the invasion. Suddenly, however, Peter,
without communicating with anyone, and without any careful
consideration, invaded the hostile land with his troops. And when on
the following day this was found out by Philemouth and Beros, the
leaders of the Eruli, they straightway followed. And when this in turn
came to the knowledge of Martinus and Valerianus and their men, they
quickly joined in the invasion. And all of them a little later united
with each other in the enemy's territory, with the exception of Justus
and his men, who, as I have said, had encamped far away from the rest
of the army, and learned later of their invasion; then, indeed, they
also invaded the territory of the enemy as quickly as possible at the
point where they were, but failed altogether to unite with the other
commanders. As for the others, they proceeded in a body straight for
Doubios, neither plundering nor damaging in any other way the land of
the Persians.</p>
<br />
<p>XXV</p>

<p>Now Doubios is a land excellent in every respect, and especially
blessed with a healthy climate and abundance of good water; and from
Theodosiopolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxv_2" id="PageII_xxv_2">[2-10]</a></span> it is removed a journey of eight days. In that
region there are plains suitable for riding, and many very populous
villages are situated in very close proximity to one another, and
numerous merchants conduct their business in them. For from India and
the neighbouring regions of Iberia and from practically all the
nations of Persia and some of those under Roman sway they bring in
merchandise and carry on their dealings with each other there. And the
priest of the Christians is called &quot;Catholicos&quot; in the Greek tongue,
because he presides alone over the whole region. Now at a distance of
about one hundred and twenty stades from Doubios on the right as one
travels from the land of the Romans, there is a mountain difficult of
ascent and moreover precipitous, and a village crowded into very
narrow space by the rough country about, Anglon by name. Thither
Nabedes withdrew with his whole army as soon as he learned of the
inroad of the enemy, and, confident in his strength of position, he
shut himself in. Now the village lies at the extremity of the
mountain, and there is a strong fortress bearing the same name as this
village on the steep mountain side. So Nabedes with stones and carts
blocked up the entrances into the village and thus made it still more
difficult of access. And in front of it he dug a sort of trench and
stationed the army there, having filled some old cabins with
ambuscades of infantrymen Altogether the Persian army amounted to four
thousand men.</p>

<p>While these things were being done in this way, the Romans reached a
place one day's journey distant from Anglon, and capturing one of the
enemy who was going out as a spy they enquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxv_10" id="PageII_xxv_10">[10-18]</a></span> where in the world
Nabedes was then. And he asserted that the man had retired from Anglon
with the whole Median army. And when Narses heard this, he was
indignant, and he heaped reproaches and abuse upon his
fellow-commanders for their hesitation. And others, too, began to do
the very same thing, casting insults upon one another; and from then
on, giving up all thought of battle and danger, they were eager to
plunder the country thereabout. The troops broke camp, accordingly,
and without the guidance of generals and without observing any
definite formation, they moved forward in complete confusion; for
neither had they any countersign among themselves, as is customary in
such perilous situations, nor were they arranged in their proper
divisions. For the soldiers marched forward, mixed in with the baggage
train, as if going to the ready plunder of great wealth. But when they
came near to Anglon, they sent out spies who returned to them
announcing the array of the enemy. And the generals were
thunder-struck by the unexpectedness of it, but they considered it
altogether disgraceful and unmanly to turn back with an army of such
great size, and so they disposed the army in its three divisions, as
well as the circumstances permitted, and advanced straight toward the
enemy. Now Peter held the right wing and Valerianus the left, while
Martinus and his men arrayed themselves in the centre. And when they
came close to their opponents, they halted, preserving their
formation, but not without disorder. The cause for this was to be
found in the difficulty of the ground, which was very badly broken up,
and in the fact that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxv_18" id="PageII_xxv_18">[18-26]</a></span> were entering battle in a formation
arranged on the spur of the moment. And up to this time the
barbarians, who had gathered themselves into a small space, were
remaining quiet, considering the strength of their antagonists, since
the order had been given them by Nabedes not under any circumstances
to begin the fighting, but if the enemy should assail them, to defend
themselves with all their might.</p>

<p>And first Narses with the Eruli and those of the Romans who were under
him, engaged with the enemy, and after a hard hand-to-hand struggle,
he routed the Persians who were before him. And the barbarians in
flight ascended on the run to the fortress, and in so doing they
inflicted terrible injury upon one another in the narrow way. And then
Narses urged his men forward and pressed still harder upon the enemy,
and the rest of the Romans joined in the action. But all of a sudden
the men who were in ambush, as has been said,<a name="FNanchor_20_52" id="FNanchor_20_52" /><a href="#Footnote_20_52" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> came out from the
cabins along the narrow alleys, and killed some of the Eruli, falling
unexpectedly upon them, and they struck Narses himself a blow on the
temple. And his brother Isaac carried him out from among the fighting
men, mortally wounded. And he died shortly afterwards, having proved
himself a brave man in this engagement. Then, as was to be expected,
great confusion fell upon the Roman army, and Nabedes let out the
whole Persian force upon his opponents. And the Persians, shooting
into great masses of the enemy in the narrow alleys, killed a large
number without difficulty, and particularly of the Eruli who had at
the first fallen upon the enemy with Narses and were fighting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxv_26" id="PageII_xxv_26">[26-33]</a></span>
the most part without protection. For the Eruli have neither helmet
nor corselet nor any other protective armour, except a shield and a
thick jacket, which they gird about them before they enter a struggle.
And indeed the Erulian slaves go into battle without even a shield,
and when they prove themselves brave men in war, then their masters
permit them to protect themselves in battle with shields. Such is the
custom of the Eruli.</p>

<p>And the Romans did not withstand the enemy and all of them fled as
fast as they could, never once thinking of resistance and heedless of
shame or of any other worthy motive. But the Persians, suspecting that
they had not turned thus to a shameless flight, but that they were
making use of some ambuscades against them, pursued them as far as the
rough ground extended and then turned back, not daring to fight a
decisive battle on level ground, a few against many. The Romans,
however, and especially all the generals, supposing that the enemy
were continuing the pursuit without pause, kept fleeing still faster,
wasting not a moment; and they were urging on their horses as they ran
with whip and voice, and throwing their corselets and other
accoutrements in haste and confusion to the ground. For they had not
the courage to array themselves against the Persians if they overtook
them, but they placed all hope of safety in their horses' feet, and,
in short, the flight became such that scarcely any one of their horses
survived, but when they stopped running, they straightway fell down
and expired. And this proved a disaster for the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxv_33" id="PageII_xxv_33">[33-5]</a></span> so great as
to exceed anything that had ever befallen them previously. For great
numbers of them perished and still more fell into the hands of the
enemy. And their weapons and draught animals which were taken by the
enemy amounted to such an imposing number that Persia seemed as a
result of this affair to have become richer. And Adolius, while
passing through a fortified place during this retreat&mdash;it was situated
in Persarmenia&mdash;was struck on the head by a stone thrown by one of the
inhabitants of the town, and died there. As for the forces of Justus
and Peranius, they invaded the country about Taraunon, and after
gathering some little plunder, immediately returned.</p>
<br />
<p>XXVI</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">544 A.D.</span>
And in the following year, Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the
fourth time invaded the land of the Romans, leading his army towards
Mesopotamia. Now this invasion was made by this Chosroes not against
Justinian, the Emperor of the Romans, nor indeed against any other
man, but only against the God whom the Christians reverence. For when
in the first invasion he retired, after failing to capture Edessa,<a name="FNanchor_21_53" id="FNanchor_21_53" /><a href="#Footnote_21_53" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
both he and the Magi, since they had been worsted by the God of the
Christians, fell into a great dejection. Wherefore Chosroes, seeking
to allay it, uttered a threat in the palace that he would make slaves
of all the inhabitants of Edessa and bring them to the land of Persia,
and would turn the city into a pasture for sheep. Accordingly when he
had approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_5" id="PageII_xxvi_5">[5-12]</a></span> city of Edessa with his whole army, he
sent some of the Huns who were following him against that portion of
the fortifications of the city which is above the hippodrome, with the
purpose of doing no further injury than seizing the flocks which the
shepherds had stationed there along the wall in great numbers: for
they were confident in the strength of the place, since it was
exceedingly steep, and supposed that the enemy would never dare to
come so very close to the wall. So the barbarians were already laying
hold of the sheep, and the shepherds were trying most valiantly to
prevent them. And when a great number of Persians had come to the
assistance of the Huns, the barbarians succeeded in detaching
something of a flock from there, but Roman soldiers and some of the
populace made a sally upon the enemy and the battle became a
hand-to-hand struggle; meanwhile the flock of its own accord returned
again to the shepherds. Now one of the Huns who was fighting before
the others was making more trouble for the Romans than all the rest.
And some rustic made a good shot and hit him on the right knee with a
sling, and he immediately fell headlong from his horse to the ground,
which thing heartened the Romans still more. And the battle which had
begun early in the morning ended at midday, and both sides withdrew
from the engagement thinking that they had the advantage. So the
Romans went inside the fortifications, while the barbarians pitched
their tents and made camp in a body about seven stades from the city.</p>

<p>Then Chosroes either saw some vision or else the thought occurred to
him that if, after making two<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_12" id="PageII_xxvi_12">[12-21]</a></span> attempts, he should not be able to
capture Edessa, he would thereby cover himself with much disgrace.
Accordingly he decided to sell his withdrawal to the citizens of
Edessa for a great sum of money. On the following day, therefore,
Paulus the interpreter came along by the wall and said that some of
the Roman notables should be sent to Chosroes. And they with all speed
chose out four of their illustrious men and sent them. When these men
reached the Median camp, they were met according to the king's order
by Zaberganes, who first terrified them with many threats and then
enquired of them which course was the more desirable for them, whether
that leading to peace, or that leading to war. And when the envoys
agreed that they would choose peace rather than the dangers of war,
Zaberganes replied: &quot;Therefore it is necessary for you to purchase
this for a great sum of money.&quot; And the envoys said that they would
give as much as they had provided before, when he came against them
after capturing Antioch. And Zaberganes dismissed them with laughter,
telling them to deliberate most carefully concerning their safety and
then to come again to the Persians. And a little later Chosroes
summoned them, and when they came before him, he recounted how many
Roman towns he had previously enslaved and in what manner he had
accomplished it; then he threatened that the inhabitants of Edessa
would receive more direful treatment at the hands of the Persians,
unless they should give them all the wealth which they had inside the
fortifications; for only on this condition, he said, would the army
depart. When the envoys heard this, they agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_21" id="PageII_xxvi_21">[21-28]</a></span> that they would
purchase peace from Chosroes, if only he would not prescribe
impossible conditions for them: but the outcome of a conflict, they
said, was plainly seen by no one at all before the struggle. For there
was never a war whose outcome might be taken for granted by those who
waged it. Thereupon Chosroes in anger commanded the envoys to be gone
with all speed.</p>

<p>On the eighth day of the siege he formed the design of erecting an
artificial hill against the circuit wall of the city; accordingly he
cut down trees in great numbers from the adjacent districts and,
without removing the leaves, laid them together in a square before the
wall, at a point which no missile from the city could reach; then he
heaped an immense amount of earth right upon the trees and above that
threw on a great quantity of stones, not such as are suitable for
building, but cut at random, and only calculated to raise the hill as
quickly as possible to a great height. And he kept laying on long
timbers in the midst of the earth and the stones, and made them serve
to bind the structure together, in order that as it became high it
should not be weak. But Peter, the Roman general (for he happened to
be there with Martinus and Peranius), wishing to check the men who
were engaged in this work, sent some of the Huns who were under his
command against them. And they, by making a sudden attack, killed a
great number; and one of the guardsmen, Argek by name, surpassed all
others, for he alone killed twenty-seven. From that time on, however,
the barbarians kept a careful guard, and there was no further
opportunity for anyone to go out against them. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_28" id="PageII_xxvi_28">[28-35]</a></span>
artisans engaged in this work, as they moved forward, came within
range of missiles, then the Romans offered a most vigorous resistance
from the city wall, using both their slings and their bows against
them. Wherefore the barbarians devised the following plan. They
provided screens of goat's hair cloth, of the kind which are called
Cilician, making them of adequate thickness and height, and attached
them to long pieces of wood which they always set before those who
were working on the &quot;agesta&quot; <a name="FNanchor_22_54" id="FNanchor_22_54" /><a href="#Footnote_22_54" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (for thus the Romans used to call
in the Latin tongue the thing which they were making). Behind this
neither ignited arrows nor any other weapon could reach the workmen,
but all of them were thrown back by the screens and stopped there. And
then the Romans, falling into a great fear, sent the envoys to
Chosroes in great trepidation, and with them Stephanus, a physician of
marked learning among those of his time at any rate, who also had once
cured Cabades, the son of Perozes, when ill, and had been made master
of great wealth by him. He, therefore, coming into the presence of
Chosroes with the others, spoke as follows: &quot;It has been agreed by
all from of old that kindness is the mark of a good king. Therefore,
most mighty King, while busying thyself with murders and battles and
the enslavement of cities it will perhaps be possible for thee to win
the other names, but thou wilt never by any means have the reputation
of being 'good.' And yet least of all cities should Edessa suffer any
adversity at thy hand. For there was I born, who, without any
foreknowledge of what was coming to pass, fostered thee from childhood
and counselled<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_35" id="PageII_xxvi_35">[35-42]</a></span> thy father to appoint thee his
successor in the kingdom, so that to thee I have proved the chief
cause of the kingship of Persia, but to my fatherland of her present
woes. For men, as a general thing, bring down upon their own heads the
most of the misfortunes which are going to befall them. But if any
remembrance of such benefaction comes to thy mind, do us no further
injury, and grant me this requital, by which, O King, thou wilt escape
the reputation of being most cruel.&quot; Such were the words of Stephanus.
But Chosroes declared that he would not depart from there until the
Romans should deliver to him Peter and Peranius, seeing that, being
his hereditary slaves, they had dared to array themselves against him.
And if it was not their pleasure to do this, the Romans must choose
one of two alternatives, either to give the Persians five hundred
centenaria of gold, or to receive into the city some of his associates
who would search out all the money, both gold and silver, as much as
was there, and bring it to him, allowing everything else to remain in
the possession of the present owners. Such then were the words which
Chosroes hurled forth, being in hopes of capturing Edessa with no
trouble. And the ambassadors (since all the conditions which he had
announced to them seemed impossible), in despair and great vexation,
proceeded to the city. And when they had come inside the city-wall,
they reported the message from Chosroes, and the whole city was filled
with tumult and lamentation.</p>

<p>Now the artificial hill was rising to a great height and was being
pushed forward with much haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvi_42" id="PageII_xxvi_42">[42-46]</a></span> And the Romans, being at a loss
what to do, again sent off the envoys to Chosroes. And when they had
arrived in the enemy's camp, and said that they had come to make
entreaty concerning the same things, they did not even gain a hearing
of any kind from the Persians, but they were insulted and driven out
from there with a great tumult, and so returned to the city. At first,
then, the Romans tried to over-top the wall opposite the hill by means
of another structure. But since the Persian work was already rising
far above even this, they stopped their building and persuaded
Martinus to make the arrangements for a settlement in whatever way he
wished. He then came up close to the enemy's camp and began to
converse with some of the Persian commanders. But they, completely
deceiving Martinus, said that their king was desirous of peace, but
that he was utterly unable to persuade the Roman Emperor to have done
with his strife with Chosroes and to establish peace with him at last.
And they mentioned as evidence of this the fact that Belisarius, who
in power and dignity was far superior to Martinus, as even he himself
would not deny, had recently persuaded the king of the Persians, when
he was in the midst of Roman territory, to withdraw from there into
Persia, promising that envoys from Byzantium would come to him at no
distant time and establish peace securely, but that he had done none
of the things agreed upon, since he had found himself unable to
overcome the determination of the Emperor Justinian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_1" id="PageII_xxvii_1">[1-6]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>XXVII</p>

<p>In the meantime the Romans were busying themselves as follows: They
made a tunnel from the city underneath the enemy's embankment,
commanding the diggers not to leave this work until they should get
under the middle of the hill. By this means they were planning to burn
the embankment. But as the tunnel advanced to about the middle of the
hill, a sound of blows, as it were, came to the ears of those Persians
who were standing above. And perceiving what was being done, they too
began from above and dug on both sides of the middle, so that they
might catch the Romans who were doing the damage there. But the Romans
found it out and abandoned this attempt, throwing earth into the place
which had been hollowed out, and then began to work on the lower part
of the embankment at the end which was next to the wall, and by taking
out timbers and stones and earth they made an open space just like a
chamber; then they threw in there dry trunks of trees of the kind
which burn most easily, and saturated them with oil of cedar and added
quantities of sulphur and bitumen. So, then, they were keeping these
things in readiness; and meanwhile the Persian commanders in frequent
meetings with Martinus were carrying on conversations with him in the
same strain as the one I have mentioned, making it appear that they
would receive proposals in regard to peace. But when at last their
hill had been completed, and had been raised to a great elevation,
approaching the circuit-wall of the city and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_6" id="PageII_xxvii_6">[6-13]</a></span> rising far above it in
height, then they sent Martinus away, definitely refusing to arrange
the treaty, and they intended from then on to devote themselves to
active warfare.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Romans straightway set fire to the tree-trunks which
had been prepared for this purpose. But when the fire had burned only
a certain portion of the embankment, and had not yet been able to
penetrate through the whole mass, the wood was already entirely
exhausted. But they kept throwing fresh wood into the pit, not
slackening their efforts for a moment. And when the fire was already
active throughout the whole embankment, some smoke appeared at night
rising from every part of the hill, and the Romans, who were not yet
willing to let the Persians know what was being done, resorted to the
following device: They filled small pots with coals and fire and threw
these and also ignited arrows in great numbers to all parts of the
embankment. And the Persians who were keeping guard there, began to go
about in great haste and extinguish these, and they supposed that the
smoke arose from them. But since the trouble increased, the barbarians
rushed up to help in great numbers, and the Romans, shooting them from
the wall, killed many. And Chosroes too came there about sunrise,
followed by the greater part of the army, and, upon mounting the hill,
he first perceived what the trouble was. For he disclosed the fact
that the cause of the smoke was underneath, not in the missiles which
the enemy were hurling, and he ordered the whole army to come to the
rescue with all speed. And the Romans, taking courage, began to insult
them, while the barbarians were at work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_13" id="PageII_xxvii_13">[13-20]</a></span> some throwing on earth,
and others water, where the smoke appeared, hoping thus to get the
better of the trouble; however, they were absolutely unable to
accomplish anything. For where the earth was thrown on, the smoke, as
was natural, was checked at that place, but not long afterwards it
rose from another place, since the fire compelled it to force its way
out wherever it could. And where the water fell most plentifully it
only succeeded in making the bitumen and the sulphur much more active,
and caused them to exert their full force upon the wood near by; and
it constantly drove the fire forward, since the water could not
penetrate inside the embankment in a quantity at all sufficient to
extinguish the flame by its abundance. And in the late afternoon the
smoke became so great in volume that it was visible to the inhabitants
of Carrhae and to some others who dwelt far beyond them. And since a
great number of Persians and of Romans had gone up on top of the
embankment, a fight took place and a hand-to-hand struggle to drive
each other off, and the Romans were victorious. Then even the flames
rose and appeared clearly above the embankment, and the Persians
abandoned this undertaking.</p>

<p>On the sixth day after this, at early dawn, they made an assault
secretly upon a certain part of the circuit-wall with ladders, at the
point which is called the Fort. And since the Romans who were keeping
guard there were sleeping a quiet, peaceful sleep, as the night was
drawing to its close, they silently set the ladders against the wall
and were already ascending. But one of the rustics alone among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_20" id="PageII_xxvii_20">[20-28]</a></span>
Romans happened to be awake, and he with a shout and a great noise
began to rouse them all. And a hard struggle ensued in which the
Persians were worsted, and they retired to their camp, leaving the
ladders where they were; these the Romans drew up at their leisure.
But Chosroes about midday sent a large part of the army against the
so-called Great Gate in order to storm the wall. And the Romans went
out and confronted them, not only soldiers, but even rustics and some
of the populace, and they conquered the barbarians in battle
decisively and turned them to flight. And while the Persians were
still being pursued, Paulus, the interpreter, came from Chosroes, and
going into the midst of the Romans, he reported that Rhecinarius had
come from Byzantium to arrange the peace; and thus the two armies
separated. Now it was already some days since Rhecinarius had arrived
at the camp of the barbarians. But the Persians had by no means
disclosed this fact to the Romans, plainly awaiting the outcome of the
attempts upon the wall which they had planned, in order that, if they
should be able to capture it, they might seem in no way to be
violating the treaty, while if defeated, as actually happened, they
might draw up the treaty at the invitation of the Romans. And when
Rhecinarius had gone inside the gates, the Persians demanded that
those who were to arrange the peace should come to Chosroes without
any delay, but the Romans said that envoys would be sent three days
later; for that just at the moment their general, Martinus, was
unwell.</p>

<p>And Chosroes, suspecting that the reason was not a sound one, prepared
for battle. And at that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_28" id="PageII_xxvii_28">[28-36]</a></span> he only threw a great mass of bricks
upon the embankment; but two days later he came against the
fortifications of the city with the whole army to storm the wall. And
at every gate he stationed some of the commanders and a part of the
army, encircling the whole wall in this way, and he brought up ladders
and war-engines against it. And in the rear he placed all the Saracens
with some of the Persians, not in order to assault the wall, but in
order that, when the city was captured, they might gather in the
fugitives and catch them as in a drag-net. Such, then, was the purpose
of Chosroes in arranging the army in this way. And the fighting began
early in the morning, and at first the Persians had the advantage. For
they were in great numbers and fighting against a very small force,
since the most of the Romans had not heard what was going on and were
utterly unprepared. But as the conflict advanced the city became full
of confusion and tumult, and the whole population, even women and
little children, were going up on to the wall. Now those who were of
military age together with the soldiers were repelling the enemy most
vigorously, and many of the rustics made a remarkable shew of valorous
deeds against the barbarians. Meanwhile the women and children, and
the aged also, were gathering stones for the fighters and assisting
them in other ways. Some also filled numerous basins with olive-oil,
and after heating them over fire a sufficient time everywhere
along the wall, they sprinkled the oil, while boiling fiercely,
upon the enemy who were assailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_36" id="PageII_xxvii_36">[36-43]</a></span> the wall, using a sort of whisk
for the purpose, and in this way harassed them still more. The
Persians, therefore, soon gave up and began to throw down their arms,
and coming before the king, said that they were no longer able to hold
out in the struggle. But Chosroes, in a passion of anger, drove them
all on with threats and urged them forward against the enemy. And the
soldiers with much shouting and tumult brought up the towers and the
other engines of war to the wall and set the ladders against it, in
order to capture the city with one grand rush. But since the Romans
were hurling great numbers of missiles and exerting all their strength
to drive them off, the barbarians were turned back by force; and as
Chosroes withdrew, the Romans taunted him, inviting him to come and
storm the wall. Only Azarethes at the so-called Soinian Gate was still
fighting with his men, at the place which they call Tripurgia.<a name="FNanchor_23_55" id="FNanchor_23_55" /><a href="#Footnote_23_55" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And
since the Romans at this point were not a match for them, but were
giving way before their assaults, already the outer wall, which they
call an outwork, had been torn down by the barbarians in many places,
and they were pressing most vigorously upon those who were defending
themselves from the great circuit-wall; but at last Peranius with a
large number of soldiers and some of the citizens went out against
them and defeated them in battle and drove them off. And the assault
which had begun early in the morning ended in the late afternoon, and
both sides remained quiet that night, the Persians fearing for their
defences and for themselves, and the Romans gathering stones and
taking them to the parapets and putting everything else in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxvii_43" id="PageII_xxvii_43">[43-2]</a></span> complete
readiness, so as to fight against the enemy on the morrow when they
should attack the wall. Now on the succeeding day not one of the
barbarians came against the fortifications; but on the day after that
a portion of the army, urged on by Chosroes, made an assault upon the
so-called Gate of Barlaus; but the Romans sallied forth and confronted
them, and the Persians were decisively beaten in the engagement, and
after a short time retired to the camp. And then Paulus, the
interpreter of the Persians, came along by the wall and called for
Martinus, in order that he might make the arrangements for the truce.
Thus Martinus came to conference with the commanders of the Persians,
and they concluded an agreement, by which Chosroes received five
centenaria from the inhabitants of Edessa, and left them, in writing,
the promise not to inflict any further injury upon the Romans; then,
after setting fire to all his defences, he returned homeward with his
whole army.</p>
<br />
<p>XXVIII</p>

<p>At about this time two generals of the Romans died, Justus, the nephew
of the emperor, and Peranius, the Iberian, of whom the former
succumbed to disease, while Peranius fell from his horse in hunting
and suffered a fatal rupture. The emperor therefore appointed others
in their places, dispatching Marcellus, his own nephew who was just
arriving at the age of manhood, and Constantianus, who a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_2" id="PageII_xxviii_2">[2-12]</a></span>
earlier had been sent as an envoy with Sergius to Chosroes. Then the
Emperor Justinian sent Constantianus and Sergius a second time to
Chosroes to arrange the truce. And they overtook him in Assyria, at
the place where there are two towns, Seleucia and Ctesiphon, built by
the Macedonians who after Alexander, the son of Philip, ruled over the
Persians and the other nations there. These two towns are separated by
the Tigris River only, for they have nothing else between them. There
the envoys met Chosroes, and they demanded that he should give back to
the Romans the country of Lazica, and establish peace with them on a
thoroughly secure basis. But Chosroes said that it was not easy for
them to come to terms with each other, unless they should first
declare an armistice, and then should continue to go back and forth to
each other without so much fear and settle their differences and make
a peace which should be on a secure basis for the future. And it was
necessary, he said, that in return for this continued armistice the
Roman Emperor should give him money and should also send a certain
physician, <a name="PageII_xxviii_8"></a>Tribunus by name, in order to spend some specified time
with him. For it happened that this physician at a former time had rid
him of a severe disease, and as a result of this he was especially
beloved and greatly missed by him. When the Emperor Justinian heard
this, he immediately sent both Tribunus and the money, amounting to
twenty centenaria.
<span class="sidenote">545 A.D.</span>
In this way the treaty was made between the Romans and the Persians
for five years, in the nineteenth year of the reign of the Emperor
Justinian.</p>

<p>And a little later Arethas and Alamoundaras, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_12" id="PageII_xxviii_12">[12-18]</a></span> rulers of the
Saracens, waged a war against each other by themselves, unaided either
by the Romans or the Persians. And Alamoundaras captured one of the
sons of Arethas in a sudden raid while he was pasturing horses, and
straightway sacrificed him to Aphrodite; and from this it was known
that Arethas was not betraying the Romans to the Persians. Later they
both came together in battle with their whole armies, and the forces
of Arethas were overwhelmingly victorious, and turning their enemy to
flight, they killed many of them. And Arethas came within a little of
capturing alive two of the sons of Alamoundaras; however, he did not
actually succeed. Such, then, was the course of events among the
Saracens.</p>

<p>But it became clear that Chosroes, the Persian king, had made the
truce with the Romans with treacherous intent, in order that he might
find them remiss on account of the peace and inflict upon them some
grave injury. For in the third year of the truce he devised the
following schemes. There were in Persia two brothers, Phabrizus and
Isdigousnas, both holding most important offices there and at the same
time reckoned to be the basest of all the Persians, and having a great
reputation for their cleverness and evil ways. Accordingly, since
Chosroes had formed the purpose of capturing the city of Daras by a
sudden stroke, and to move all the Colchians out of Lazica and
establish in their place Persian settlers, he selected these two men
to assist him in both undertakings. For it seemed to him that it would
be a lucky stroke and a really important achievement to win for
himself the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_18" id="PageII_xxviii_18">[18-24]</a></span> Colchis and to have it in secure possession,
reasoning that this would be advantageous to the Persian empire in
many ways. In the first place they would have Iberia in security
forever afterwards, since the Iberians would not have anyone with
whom, if they revolted, they might find safety; for since the most
notable men of these barbarians together with their king, Gourgenes,
had looked towards revolt, as I have stated in the preceding
pages,<a name="FNanchor_24_56" id="FNanchor_24_56" /><a href="#Footnote_24_56" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the Persians from that time on did not permit them to set
up a king over themselves, nor were the Iberians single-minded
subjects of the Persians, but there was much suspicion and distrust
between them. And it was evident that the Iberians were most
thoroughly dissatisfied and that they would attempt a revolution
shortly if they could only seize upon some favourable opportunity.
Furthermore, the Persian empire would be forever free from plunder by
the Huns who lived next to Lazica, and he would send them against the
Roman domains more easily and readily, whenever he should so desire.
For he considered that, as regards the barbarians dwelling in the
Caucasus, Lazica was nothing else than a bulwark against them. But
most of all he hoped that the subjugation of Lazica would afford this
advantage to the Persians, that starting from there they might overrun
with no trouble both by land and by sea the countries along the Euxine
Sea, as it is called, and thus win over the Cappadocians and the
Galatians and Bithynians who adjoin them, and capture Byzantium by a
sudden assault with no one opposing them. For these reasons, then,
Chosroes was anxious to gain possession of Lazica, but in the Lazi<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_24" id="PageII_xxviii_24">[24-31]</a></span>
he had not the least confidence. For since the time when the Romans
had withdrawn from Lazica, the common people of the country naturally
found the Persian rule burdensome. For the Persians are beyond all
other men singular in their ways, and they are excessively rigid as
regards the routine of daily life. And their laws are difficult of
access for all men, and their requirements quite unbearable. But in
comparison with the Lazi the difference of their thinking and living
shews itself in an altogether exceptional degree, since the Lazi are
Christians of the most thorough-going kind, while all the Persian
views regarding religion are the exact opposite of theirs. And apart
from this, salt is produced nowhere in Lazica, nor indeed does grain
grow there nor the vine nor any other good thing. But from the Romans
along the coast everything is brought in to them by ship, and even so
they do not pay gold to the traders, but hides and slaves and whatever
else happens to be found there in great abundance; and when they were
excluded from this trade, they were, as was to be expected, in a state
of constant vexation. When, therefore, Chosroes perceived this, he was
eager to anticipate with certainty any move on their part to revolt
against him. And upon considering the matter, it seemed to him to be
the most advantageous course to put Goubazes, the king of the Lazi,
out of the way as quickly as possible, and to move the Lazi in a body
out of the country, and then to colonize this land with Persians and
certain other nations.</p>

<p>When Chosroes had matured these plans, he sent Isdigousnas to
Byzantium, ostensibly to act as an envoy, and he picked out five
hundred of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_31" id="PageII_xxviii_31">[31-37]</a></span> valorous of the Persians and sent them with
him, directing them to get inside the city of Daras, and to take their
lodgings in many different houses, and at night to set these all on
fire, and, while all the Romans were occupied with this fire, as was
natural, to open the gates immediately, and receive the rest of the
Persian army into the city. For word had been sent previously to the
commander of the city of Nisibis to conceal a large force of soldiers
near by and hold them in readiness. For in this way Chosroes thought
that they would destroy all the Romans with no trouble, and seizing
the city of Daras, would hold it securely. But someone who knew well
what was being arranged, a Roman who had come to the Persians as a
deserter a little earlier, told everything to George, who was staying
there at the time; now this was the same man whom I mentioned in the
preceding pages<a name="FNanchor_25_57" id="FNanchor_25_57" /><a href="#Footnote_25_57" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as having persuaded the Persians who were besieged
in the fortress of Sisauranon to surrender themselves to the Romans.
George therefore met this ambassador at the boundary line between
Roman and Persian soil and said that this thing he was doing was not
after the fashion of an embassy, and that never had so numerous a body
of Persians stopped for the night in a city of the Romans. For he
ought, he said, to have left behind all the rest in the town of
Ammodios, and must himself enter the city of Daras with some few men.
Now Isdigousnas was indignant and appeared to take it ill, because he
had been insulted wrongfully, in spite of the fact that he was
dispatched on an embassy to the Roman emperor. But George, paying no
heed to him in his fury, saved the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxviii_37" id="PageII_xxviii_37">[37-44]</a></span> for the Romans. For he
received Isdigousnas into the city with only twenty men.</p>

<p>So having failed in this attempt, the barbarian came to Byzantium as
if on an embassy, bringing with him his wife and two daughters (for
this was his pretext for the crowd which had been gathered about him);
but when he came before the emperor, he was unable to say anything
great or small about any serious matter, although he wasted no less
than ten months in Roman territory. However, he gave the emperor the
gifts from Chosroes, as is customary, and a letter, in which Chosroes
requested the Emperor Justinian to send word whether he was enjoying
the best possible health. Nevertheless the Emperor Justinian received
this Isdigousnas with more friendliness and treated him with greater
honour than any of the other ambassadors of whom we know. So true was
this that, whenever he entertained him, he caused Braducius, who
followed him as interpreter, to recline with him on the couch, a thing
which had never before happened in all time. For no one ever saw an
interpreter become a table-companion of even one of the more humble
officials, not to speak of a king. But he both received and dismissed
this man in a style more splendid than that which befits an
ambassador, although he had undertaken the embassy for no serious
business, as I have said. For if anyone should count up the money
expended and the gifts which Isdigousnas carried with him when he went
away, he will find them amounting to more than ten centenaria of gold.
So the plot against the city of Daras ended in this way for
Chosroes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_1" id="PageII_xxix_1">[xxix1-7]</a></span></p>
<br />
<p>XXIX</p>

<p>His first move against Lazica was as follows. He sent into the country
a great amount of lumber suitable for the construction of ships,
explaining to no one what his purpose was in so doing, but ostensibly
he was sending it in order to set up engines of war on the
fortifications of Petra. Next he chose out three hundred able warriors
of the Persians, and sent them there under command of Phabrizus, whom
I have lately mentioned, ordering him to make away with Goubazes as
secretly as possible; as for the rest, he himself would take care. Now
when this lumber had been conveyed to Lazica, it happened that it was
struck suddenly by lightning and reduced to ashes. And Phabrizus, upon
arriving in Lazica with the three hundred, began to contrive so that
he might carry out the orders received by him from Chosroes regarding
Goubazes. Now it happened that one of the men of note among the
Colchians, Pharsanses by name, had quarrelled with Goubazes and in
consequence had become exceedingly hostile to him, and now he did not
dare at all to go into the presence of the king. When this was learned
by Phabrizus, he summoned Pharsanses and in a conference with him
disclosed the whole project, and enquired of the man in what way he
ought to go about the execution of the deed. And it seemed best to
them after deliberating together that Phabrizus should go into the
city of Petra, and should summon Goubazes there, in order to announce
to him what the king had decided concerning the interests of the Lazi.
But Pharsanses secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_7" id="PageII_xxix_7">[7-14]</a></span> revealed to Goubazes what was being
prepared. He, accordingly, did not come to Phabrizus at all, but began
openly to plan a revolt. Then Phabrizus commanded the other Persians
to attend as carefully as they could to the guarding of Petra, and to
make everything as secure as possible against a siege, and he himself
with the three hundred returned homeward without having accomplished
his purpose. And Goubazes reported to the Emperor Justinian the
condition in which they were, and begged him to grant forgiveness for
what the Lazi had done in the past, and to come to their defence with
all his strength, since they desired to be rid of the Median rule. For
if left by themselves the Colchians would not be able to repel the
power of the Persians.</p>

<p>When the Emperor Justinian heard this, he was overjoyed, and sent
seven thousand men under the leadership of Dagisthaeus and a thousand <a name="PageII_xxix_10"></a>
Tzani to the assistance of the Lazi. And when this force reached the
land of Colchis, they encamped together with Goubazes and the Lazi
about the fortifications of Petra and commenced a siege. But since the
Persians who were there made a most stalwart defence from the wall, it
came about that much time was spent in the siege; for the Persians had
put away an ample store of victuals in the town. And Chosroes, being
greatly disturbed by these things, dispatched a great army of horse
and foot against the besiegers, putting Mermeroes in command of them.
And when Goubazes learned of this, he considered the matter together
with Dagisthaeus and acted in the manner which I shall presently set
forth.</p>
<p>The river Boas rises close to the territory of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_14" id="PageII_xxix_14">[14-19]</a></span>
Tzani among the Armenians who dwell around Pharangium. And at first
its course inclines to the right for a great distance, and its stream
is small and can be forded by anyone with no trouble as far as the
place where the territory of the Iberians lies on the right, and the
end of the Caucasus lies directly opposite.
In that place many nations
have their homes, and among them the Alani and Abasgi, who are
Christians and friends of the Romans from of old; also the Zechi, and
after them the Huns who bear the name Sabeiri. But when this river
reaches the point which marks the termination of the Caucasus and of
Iberia as well, there other waters also are added to it and it becomes
much larger and from there flows on bearing the name of Phasis instead
of Boas<a name="FNanchor_26_58" id="FNanchor_26_58" /><a href="#Footnote_26_58" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; and it becomes a navigable stream as far as the so-called
Euxine Sea into which it empties; and on either side of it lies
Lazica. Now on the right of the stream particularly the whole country
for a great distance is populated by the people of Lazica as far as
the boundary of Iberia. For all the villages of the Lazi are here
beyond the river, and towns have been built there from of old, among
which are Archaeopolis, a very strong place, and Sebastopolis, and the
fortress of Pitius, and Scanda and Sarapanis over against the boundary
of Iberia. Moreover there are two cities of the greatest importance in
that region, Rhodopolis and Mocheresis. But on the left of the river,
while the country belongs to Lazica as far as one day's journey for an
unencumbered traveller, the land is without human habitation.
Adjoining this land is the home of the Romans who<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_19" id="PageII_xxix_19">[19-27]</a></span> are called
Pontic. Now it was in the territory of Lazica, in the part which was
altogether uninhabited, that the Emperor Justinian founded the city of
Petra in my own time. This was the place where John, surnamed Tzibus,
established the monopoly, as I have told in the previous
narrative,<a name="FNanchor_27_59" id="FNanchor_27_59" /><a href="#Footnote_27_59" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and gave cause to the Lazi to revolt. And as one leaves
the city of Petra going southward, the Roman territory commences
immediately, and there are populous towns there, and one which bears
the name of Rhizaeum, also Athens and certain others as far as
Trapezus. Now when the Lazi brought in Chosroes, they crossed the
River Boas and came to Petra keeping the Phasis on the right, because,
as they said, they would thus provide against being compelled to spend
much time and trouble in ferrying the men across the River Phasis, but
in reality they did not wish to display their own homes to the
Persians. And yet Lazica is everywhere difficult to traverse both to
the right and to the left of the River Phasis. For there are on both
sides of the river exceedingly high and jagged mountains, and as a
result the passes are narrow and very long. (The Romans call the roads
through such passes &quot;clisurae&quot; when they put their own word into a
Greek form.<a name="FNanchor_28_60" id="FNanchor_28_60" /><a href="#Footnote_28_60" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>) But since at that time Lazica happened to be
unguarded, the Persians had reached Petra very easily with the Lazi
who were their guides.</p>

<p>But on this occasion Goubazes, upon learning of the advance of the
Persians, directed Dagisthaeus to send some men to guard with all
their strength the pass which is below the River Phasis, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_27" id="PageII_xxix_27">[27-34]</a></span>
bade him not on any account to abandon the siege until they should be
able to capture Petra and the Persians in it. He himself meanwhile
with the whole Colchian army came to the frontier of Lazica, in order
to devote all his strength to guarding the pass there. Now it happened
that long before he had persuaded the Alani and Sabeiri to form an
alliance with him, and they had agreed for three centenaria not merely
to assist the Lazi in guarding the land from plunder, but also to
render Iberia so destitute of men that not even the Persians would be
able to come in from there in the future. And Goubazes had promised
that the emperor would give them this money. So he reported the
agreement to the Emperor Justinian and besought him to send this money
for the barbarians and afford the Lazi some consolation in their great
distress. He also stated that the treasury owed him his salary for ten
years, for though he was assigned a post among the privy counsellors
in the palace, he had received no payment from it since the time when
Chosroes came into the land of Colchis. And the Emperor Justinian
intended to fulfil this request, but some business came up to occupy
his attention and he did not send the money at the proper time. So
Goubazes was thus engaged.</p>

<p>But Dagisthaeus, being a rather young man and by no means competent to
carry on a war against Persia, did not handle the situation properly.
For while he ought to have sent certainly the greater part of the army
to the pass, and perhaps should have assisted in person in this
enterprise, he sent only one hundred men, just as if he were managing
a matter of secondary importance. He himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_34" id="PageII_xxix_34">[34-42]</a></span> moreover, though
besieging Petra with the whole army, accomplished nothing, although
the enemy were few. For while they had been at the beginning not less
than fifteen hundred, they had been shot at by Romans and Lazi in
their fighting at the wall for a long time, and had made a display of
valour such as no others known to us have made, so that many were
falling constantly and they were reduced to an exceedingly small
number. So while the Persians, plunged in despair and at a loss what
to do, were remaining quiet, the Romans made a trench along the wall
for a short space, and the circuit-wall at this point fell
immediately. But it happened that inside this space there was a
building which did not stand back at all from the circuit-wall, and
this reached to the whole length of the fallen portion; thus, taking
the place of the wall for the besieged, it rendered them secure none
the less. But this was not sufficient greatly to disturb the Romans.
For knowing well that by doing the same thing elsewhere they would
capture the city with the greatest ease, they became still more
hopeful than before. For this reason Dagisthaeus sent word to the
emperor of what had come to pass, and proposed that prizes of victory
should be in readiness for him, indicating what rewards the emperor
should bestow upon himself and his brother; for he would capture Petra
after no great time. So the Romans and the Tzani made a most vigorous
assault upon the wall, but the Persians unexpectedly withstood them,
although only a very few were left. And since the Romans were
accomplishing nothing by assaulting the wall, they again turned to
digging. And they went so far in this work that the foundations of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxix_42" id="PageII_xxix_42">[42-6]</a></span> circuit-wall were no longer on solid ground, but stood for the
most part over empty space, and, in the nature of things, would fall
almost immediately. And if Dagisthaeus had been willing immediately to
apply fire to the foundations, I think that the city would have been
captured by them straightway; but, as it was, he was awaiting
encouragement from the emperor, and so, always hesitating and wasting
time, he remained inactive. Such, then, was the course of events in
the Roman camp.</p>
<br />
<p>XXX</p>

<p>But Mermeroes, after passing the Iberian frontier with the whole
Median army, was moving forward with the River Phasis on his right.
For he was quite unwilling to go through the country of Lazica, lest
any obstacle should confront him there. For he was eager to save the
city of Petra and the Persians in it, even though a portion of the
circuit-wall had fallen down suddenly. For it had been hanging in the
air, as I have said; and volunteers from the Roman army to the number
of fifty got inside the city, and raised the shout proclaiming the
Emperor Justinian triumphant. These men were led by a young man of
Armenian birth, John by name, the son of Thomas whom they used to call
by the surname Gouzes. This Thomas had built many of the strongholds
about Lazica at the direction of the emperor, and he commanded the
soldiers there, seeming to the emperor an intelligent person. Now
John, when the Persians joined battle with his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_6" id="PageII_xxx_6">[6-12]</a></span> was wounded and
straightway withdrew to the camp with his followers, since no one else
of the Roman army came to support him. Meanwhile the Persian Mirranes
who commanded the garrison in Petra, fearing for the city, directed
all the Persians to keep guard with the greatest diligence, and he
himself went to Dagisthaeus, and addressed him with fawning speeches
and deceptive words, agreeing readily to surrender the city not long
afterwards. In this way he succeeded in deceiving him so that the
Roman army did not immediately enter the city.</p>

<p>Now when the army of Mermeroes came to the pass, the Roman garrison,
numbering one hundred men, confronted them there and offered a
stalwart resistance, and they held in check their opponents who were
attempting the entrance. But the Persians by no means withdrew, but
those who fell were constantly replaced by others, and they kept
advancing, trying with all their strength to force their way in. Among
the Persians more than a thousand perished, but at last the Romans
were worn out with killing, and, being forced back by the throng, they
withdrew, and running up to the heights of the mountain there were
saved. Dagisthaeus, upon learning this, straightway abandoned the
siege without giving any commands to the army, and proceeded to the
River Phasis; and all the Romans followed him, leaving their
possessions behind in the camp. And when the Persians observed what
was being done, they opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_12" id="PageII_xxx_12">[12-18]</a></span> their gates and came forth, and
approached the tents of the enemy in order to capture the camp. But
the Tzani, who had not followed after Dagisthaeus, as it happened,
rushed out to defend the camp, and they routed the enemy without
difficulty and killed many. So the Persians fled inside their
fortifications, and the Tzani, after plundering the Roman camp
proceeded straight for Rhizaeum. And from there they came to Athens
and betook themselves to their homes through the territory of the
Trapezuntines.</p>

<p>And Mermeroes and the Median army came there on the ninth day after
the withdrawal of Dagisthaeus; and in the city they found left of the
Persian garrison three hundred and fifty men wounded and unfit for
fighting, and only one hundred and fifty men unhurt; for all the rest
had perished. Now the survivors had in no case thrown the bodies of
the fallen outside the fortifications, but though stifled by the evil
stench, they held out in a manner beyond belief, in order that they
might not afford the enemy any encouragement for the prosecution of
the siege, by letting them know that most of their number had
perished. And Mermeroes remarked by way of a taunt that the Roman
state was worthy of tears and lamentation, because they had come to
such a state of weakness that they had been unable by any device to
capture one hundred and fifty Persians without a wall. And he was
eager to build up the portions of the circuit-wall which had fallen
down; but since at the moment he had neither lime nor any of the other
necessary materials for the building ready at hand, he devised the
following plan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_18" id="PageII_xxx_18">[18-24]</a></span> Filling with sand the linen bags in which the
Persians had carried their provisions into the land of Colchis, he
laid them in the place of the stones, and the bags thus arranged took
the place of the wall. And choosing out three thousand of his able
fighting men, he left them there, depositing with them victuals for no
great length of time, and commanding them to attend to the building of
the fortifications; then he himself with all the rest of the army
turned back and marched away.</p>

<p>But since, if he went from there by the same road, no means of
provisioning his army was available, since he had left everything in
Petra which had been brought in by the army from Iberia, he planned to
go by another route through the mountains, where he learned that the
country was inhabited, in order that by foraging there he might be
able to live off the land. In the course of this journey one of the
notables among the Lazi, Phoubelis by name, laid an ambush for the
Persians while camping for the night, bringing with him Dagisthaeus
with two thousand of the Romans; and these men, making a sudden
attack, killed some of the Persians who were grazing their horses, and
after securing the horses as plunder they shortly withdrew. Thus,
then, Mermeroes with the Median army departed from there.</p>

<p>But Goubazes, upon learning what had befallen the Romans both at Petra
and at the pass, did not even so become frightened, nor did he give up
the guarding of the pass where he was, considering that their hope
centred in that place. For he understood that, even if the Persians
had been able by forcing back the Romans on the left of the River
Phasis to cross over the pass and get into Petra, they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_24" id="PageII_xxx_24">[24-31]</a></span>
thereby inflict no injury upon the land of the Lazi, since they were
utterly unable to cross the Phasis, in particular because no ships
were at their disposal. For in depth this river is not inferior to the
deepest rivers, and it spreads out to a great width. Moreover it has
such a strong current that when it empties into the sea, it goes on as
a separate stream for a very great distance, without mingling at all
with the sea-water. Indeed, those who navigate in those parts are able
to draw up drinking water in the midst of the sea. Moreover, the Lazi
have erected fortresses all along the right bank of the river, in
order that, even when the enemy are ferried across in boats, they may
not be able to disembark on the land.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justinian at this time sent to the nation of the Sabeiri
the money which had been agreed upon, and he rewarded Goubazes and the
Lazi with additional sums of money. And it happened that long before
this time he had sent another considerable army also to Lazica, which
had not yet arrived there. The commander of this army was
Rhecithancus, from Thrace, a man of discretion and a capable warrior.
Such then was the course of these events.</p>

<p>Now when Mermeroes got into the mountains, as I have said, he was
anxious to fill Petra with provisions from there. For he did not by
any means think that the victuals which they had brought in with them
would suffice for the garrison there, amounting to three thousand men.
But since the supplies they found along the way barely sufficed for
the provisioning of that army, which numbered no less than thirty
thousand, and since on this account<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_31" id="PageII_xxx_31">[31-37]</a></span> they were able to send nothing
at all of consequence to Petra, upon consideration he found it better
for them that the greater part of the army should depart from the land
of Colchis, and that some few should remain there, who were to convey
to the garrison in Petra the most of the provisions which they might
find, while using the rest to maintain themselves comfortably. He
therefore selected five thousand men and left them there, appointing
as commanders over them Phabrizus and three others. For it seemed to
him unnecessary to leave more men there, since there was no enemy at
all. And he himself with the rest of the army came into Persarmenia
and remained quietly in the country around Doubios.</p>

<p>Now the five thousand, upon coming nearer to the frontier of Lazica,
encamped in a body beside the Phasis River, and from there they went
about in small bands and plundered the neighbouring country. Now when
Goubazes perceived this, he sent word to Dagisthaeus to hasten there
to his assistance: for it would be possible for them to do the enemy
some great harm. And he did as directed, moving forward with the whole
Roman army with the River Phasis on the left, until he came to the
place where the Lazi where encamped on the opposite bank of the river.
Now it happened that the Phasis could be forded at this point, a fact
which neither the Romans nor the Persians suspected in the least
because of their lack of familiarity with these regions; but the Lazi
knew it well, and they made the crossing suddenly and joined the Roman
army. And the Persians chose out a thousand men of repute among them
and sent them forth, that no one might advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_37" id="PageII_xxx_37">[37-45]</a></span> against the camp to
harm it. And two of this force, who had gone out ahead of their
fellows to reconnoitre, fell unexpectedly into the hands of the enemy
and informed them of the whole situation. The Romans, therefore, and
the Lazi fell suddenly upon the thousand men, and not one of them
succeeded in escaping, but the most of them were slain, while some
also were captured; and through these the men of Goubazes and
Dagisthaeus succeeded in learning the numbers of the Median army and
the length of the journey to them and the condition in which they then
were. They therefore broke camp and marched against them with their
whole army, calculating so that they would fall upon them well on in
the night; their own force amounted to fourteen thousand men. Now the
Persians, having no thought of an enemy in their minds, were enjoying
a long sleep; for they supposed that the river was impassable, and
that the thousand men, with no one to oppose them, were making a long
march somewhere. But the Romans and Lazi at early dawn unexpectedly
fell upon them, and they found some still buried in slumber and others
just roused from sleep and lying defenceless upon their beds. Not one
of them, therefore, thought of resistance, and the majority were
caught and killed, while some also were captured by the enemy, among
whom happened to be one of the commanders; only a few escaped in the
darkness and were saved. And the Romans and Lazi captured the camp and
all the standards, and they also secured many weapons and a great deal
of money as plunder, besides great numbers of horses and mules. And
pursuing them for a very great distance they came well into Iberia.
There they happened upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_45" id="PageII_xxx_45">[45-54]</a></span> certain others of the Persians also and
slew a great number. Thus the Persians departed from Lazica; and the
Romans and Lazi found there all the supplies, including great
quantities of flour, which the barbarians had brought in from Iberia,
in order to transport them to Petra, and they burned them all. And
they left a large number of Lazi in the pass, so that it might no
longer be possible for the Persians to carry in supplies to Petra, and
they returned with all the plunder and the captives.
<span class="sidenote">549 A.D.</span>
And the fourth
year of the truce between the Romans and Persians came to an end,
being the twenty-third year of the reign of the Emperor
Justinian.</p>

<p>And John the Cappadocian one year before this came to Byzantium at the
summons of the emperor. For at that time the Empress Theodora had
reached the term of her life. However, he was quite unable to recover
any of his former dignities, but he continued to hold the priestly
honour against his will; and yet the vision had often come to the man
that he would arrive at royalty. For the divine power is accustomed to
tempt those whose minds are not solidly grounded by nature, by holding
before their vision, on great and lofty hopes, that which is counted
splendid among men. At any rate the marvel-mongers were always
predicting to this John many such imaginary things, and especially
that he was bound to be clothed in the garment of Augustus. Now there
was a certain priest in Byzantium, Augustus by name, who guarded the
treasures of the temple of Sophia. So when John had been shorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageII_xxx_54" id="PageII_xxx_54">[54]</a></span> and
declared worthy of the priestly dignity by force, inasmuch as he had
no garment becoming a priest, he had been compelled by those who were
in charge of this business to put on the cloak and the tunic of this
Augustus who was near by, and in this, I suppose, his prophecy reached
its fulfilment.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
